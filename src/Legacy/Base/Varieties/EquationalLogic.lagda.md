### <a id="equational-logic">Equational Logic</a>

This is the [Base.Varieties.EquationalLogic][] module of the [Agda Universal Algebra Library][] where the binary "models" relation `⊧`, relating algebras (or classes of algebras) to the identities that they satisfy, is defined.

Let `𝑆` be a signature. By an *identity* or *equation* in `𝑆` we mean an ordered pair of terms, written `p ≈ q`, from the term algebra `𝑻 X`. If `𝑨` is an `𝑆`-algebra we say that `𝑨` *satisfies* `p ≈ q` provided `p ̇ 𝑨 ≡ q ̇ 𝑨` holds. In this situation, we write `𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q` and say that `𝑨` *models* the identity `p ≈ q`. If `𝒦` is a class of `𝑆`-algebras, then we write `𝒦 ⊧ p ≈ q` iff, for every `𝑨 ∈ 𝒦`, `𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q`.

Because a class of structures has a different type than a single structure, we must use a slightly different syntax to avoid overloading the relations `⊧` and `≈`. As a reasonable alternative to what we would normally express informally as `𝒦 ⊧ p ≈ q`, we have settled on `𝒦 ⊫ p ≈ q` to denote this relation.  To reiterate, if `𝒦` is a class of `𝑆`-algebras, we write `𝒦 ⊫ p ≈ q` iff every `𝑨 ∈ 𝒦` satisfies `𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q`.

#### <a id="the-models-relation">The models relation</a>

We define the binary "models" relation `⊧` using infix syntax so that we may
write, e.g., `𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q` or `𝒦 ⊫ p ≈ q`, relating algebras (or classes of
algebras) to the identities that they satisfy. We also prove a couple of useful
facts about `⊧`.


```agda


_⊧_≈_ : Algebra α → Term X → Term X → Type _
𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q = 𝑨 ⟦ p ⟧ ≈ 𝑨 ⟦ q ⟧

_⊫_≈_ : Pred(Algebra α) ρ → Term X → Term X → Type _
𝒦 ⊫ p ≈ q = {𝑨 : Algebra _} → 𝒦 𝑨 → 𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q
```


**Unicode tip**. Type `\models` to get `⊧` ; type `\||=` to get `⊫`.

The expression `𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q` represents the assertion that the identity `p ≈ q`
holds when interpreted in the algebra `𝑨`; syntactically, `𝑨 ⟦ p ⟧ ≈ 𝑨 ⟦ q ⟧`.

The expression `𝑨 ⟦ p ⟧ ≈ 𝑨 ⟦ q ⟧` denotes *extensional equality*; that is,
for each "environment" `η :  X → ∣ 𝑨 ∣` (assigning values in the domain of `𝑨`
to the variable symbols in `X`) the (intensional) equality `𝑨 ⟦ p ⟧ η ≡ 𝑨 ⟦ q ⟧ η`
holds.


#### <a id="equational-theories-and-models">Equational theories and models</a>

If `𝒦` denotes a class of structures, then `Th 𝒦` represents the set of identities
modeled by the members of `𝒦`.


```agda


Th : Pred (Algebra α) (ov α) → Pred(Term X × Term X) _
Th 𝒦 = λ (p , q) → 𝒦 ⊫ p ≈ q
```


We represent ``Th 𝒦`` as an indexed collection of algebras by taking `Th 𝒦`,
itself, to be the index set.


```agda


module _ {X : Type χ}{𝒦 : Pred (Algebra α) (ov α)} where

 ℐ : Type (ov(α ⊔ χ))
 ℐ = Σ[ (p , q) ∈ (Term X × Term X) ] 𝒦 ⊫ p ≈ q

 ℰ : ℐ → Term X × Term X
 ℰ ((p , q) , _) = (p , q)
```


If `ℰ` denotes a set of identities, then `Mod ℰ` is the class of structures
satisfying the identities in `ℰ`.


```agda


Mod : Pred(Term X × Term X) (ov α) → Pred(Algebra α) _
Mod ℰ = λ 𝑨 → ∀ p q → (p , q) ∈ ℰ → 𝑨 ⊧ p ≈ q
-- (tupled version)
Modᵗ : {I : Type ι} → (I → Term X × Term X) → {α : Level} → Pred(Algebra α) _
Modᵗ ℰ = λ 𝑨 → ∀ i → 𝑨 ⊧ (fst (ℰ i)) ≈ (snd (ℰ i))
```
