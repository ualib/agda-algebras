### Complete Lattices

This is the [Setoid.Algebras.Lattices.CompleteLattice][] module of the [Agda Universal Algebra Library][].

The standard library provides order-theoretic semilattices, lattices, and bounded
lattices, but no *complete* lattice, so we record one here.  A **complete lattice**
is a partially ordered set in which every family of elements (indexed by a type at a
fixed level `ι`) has a supremum and an infimum.

Although this notion is pure order theory, complete lattices are pervasive in
universal algebra — the congruence lattice
([Setoid.Algebras.Congruences.CompleteLattice][]) and the subalgebra lattice are the
motivating instances — so we keep the definition in the `Algebras` tree rather than
relegating it to `Classical`.  Every supremum/infimum is required to exist only for
`ι`-small index types, the customary predicative reading of "complete".

```agda

module Setoid.Algebras.Lattices.CompleteLattice where

-- Imports from the Agda Standard Library ---------------------------------------
open import Agda.Primitive   using () renaming ( Set to Type )
open import Level            using ( Level ; _⊔_ ; suc )
open import Relation.Binary  using ( IsPartialOrder ) renaming ( Rel to BinRel )
```

`CompleteLattice c ℓ₁ ℓ₂ ι` is a carrier at level `c` with an equality at level `ℓ₁`
and a partial order at level `ℓ₂`, such that every `ι`-indexed family has a least
upper bound `⨆` and a greatest lower bound `⨅`.

```agda
record CompleteLattice (c ℓ₁ ℓ₂ ι : Level) : Type (suc (c ⊔ ℓ₁ ⊔ ℓ₂ ⊔ ι)) where
 field
  Carrier          : Type c
  _≈ᶜ_            : BinRel Carrier ℓ₁
  _≤ᶜ_            : BinRel Carrier ℓ₂
  isPartialOrderᶜ  : IsPartialOrder _≈ᶜ_ _≤ᶜ_

  -- Infinitary supremum and infimum of an ι-indexed family.
  ⨆ : {I : Type ι} → (I → Carrier) → Carrier
  ⨅ : {I : Type ι} → (I → Carrier) → Carrier

  -- ⨆ f is the least upper bound of the family f.
  ⨆-upper  : {I : Type ι} (f : I → Carrier) (i : I) → (f i) ≤ᶜ (⨆ f)
  ⨆-least  : {I : Type ι} (f : I → Carrier) (x : Carrier) → (∀ i → (f i) ≤ᶜ x) → (⨆ f) ≤ᶜ x

  -- ⨅ f is the greatest lower bound of the family f.
  ⨅-lower     : {I : Type ι} (f : I → Carrier) (i : I) → (⨅ f) ≤ᶜ (f i)
  ⨅-greatest  : {I : Type ι} (f : I → Carrier) (x : Carrier) → (∀ i → x ≤ᶜ (f i)) → x ≤ᶜ (⨅ f)
