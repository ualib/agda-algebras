### Decidable equational laws over a searchable decidable setoid

This is the [Setoid.Operations.Properties][] module of the [Agda Universal Algebra Library][].

The finite law-checkers of [Overture.Operations.Properties][] decide each equational
law of an operation `Fin n → Fin n → Fin n` by nesting `all?`{.AgdaFunction}
(`Data.Fin.Properties.all?`) over decidable equality `_≟_`{.AgdaFunction} on
`Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype}.  Their decidability rests on exactly two facts about the
carrier, and *neither is special to* `Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype} *or to*
`_≡_`{.AgdaDatatype}.

1.  The carrier is **exhaustively searchable** — a pointwise decision procedure
    `∀ x → Dec (P x)` can be turned into a decision `Dec (∀ x → P x)` for the
    universally-quantified statement (this is what `all?`{.AgdaFunction} provides).
2.  The carrier has **decidable equality** — supplied here by the decidable
    `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction} of a `DecSetoid`{.AgdaRecord}.

This module restates the eleven checkers over an arbitrary `DecSetoid`{.AgdaRecord}
`S` — deciding `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction} through the decidable equality relation
`_≟_`{.AgdaFunction} of `S` — together with an exhaustive-search witness for its
carrier, writing each law with `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction} in place of `_≡_`{.AgdaDatatype}.

The operation remains a bare function `Carrier → Carrier → Carrier`; the decision
never needs it to respect `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction}, exactly as in the concrete versions.
The finite `Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype} / `_≡_`{.AgdaDatatype} checkers are then recovered
as a single instance: take `S` to be the propositional `DecSetoid`{.AgdaRecord} on
`Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype} and the search witness to be the `all?`{.AgdaFunction} of
`Fin`.

The final section proves that each concrete checker *equals* its generalized form at
this instance, by `refl`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor}; so the fast-reducing concrete
checkers (on which the finite examples and their `from-yes`{.AgdaFunction} proofs
depend) are kept exactly as they are, with the generalization exhibited alongside
rather than replacing them.

The search ingredient is isolated below as a one-field interface,
`Exhaustible`{.AgdaRecord}, deliberately kept independent of `Fin`{.AgdaDatatype} so
that any carrier that admits such a search functional can drive the checkers.

Finite carriers are the obvious source, but not the only one.  For instance, Martín
Escardó's work on *exhaustively searchable* types shows that even some *infinite*
carriers (e.g. `ℕ∞`, the one-point compactification of `ℕ`) admit a total search
functional.  Supplying those carriers' search functionals is planned work;[^1]
this module only fixes the interface they would implement.

```agda
{-# OPTIONS --cubical-compatible --exact-split --safe #-}

module Setoid.Operations.Properties where

open import Agda.Primitive                         renaming ( Set to Type ; Setω to Typeω )

-- Imports from the Agda Standard Library -------------------------------------
open import Data.Bool.Base                         using ( Bool ; false ; true ; _∧_ ; _∨_ )

```

#### The exhaustive-search interface

A carrier `A` is *exhaustively searchable* — for the purpose of deciding
universally-quantified decidable predicates — when it carries a single functional
that turns any pointwise decision procedure `∀ x → Dec (P x)` into a decision
`Dec (∀ x → P x)` for the universal statement.  This is exactly the shape of
`Data.Fin.Properties.all?`, but here we abstract the carrier beyond `Fin`.

We package the interface as a single-field record so that a witness
`E : Exhaustible A` can be passed to the checkers and its search functional opened
under the name `all?`{.AgdaFunction}, making the generalized call sites read
identically to the concrete `Fin` ones.  The record mentions no setoid and no
`Fin`{.AgdaDatatype}; it is a property of a bare carrier.[^2]

The field is universe-polymorphic in the predicate level `p`, so the record lives in
`Typeω`{.AgdaPrimitiveType}.  This is needed because the nested checkers apply the
same functional at two different predicate levels (`ℓ` innermost and `c ⊔ ℓ` after a
quantifier).

```agda
-- An exhaustive-search witness for a carrier A: it decides any universally-
-- quantified predicate whose pointwise instances are decidable.  The abstraction
-- of Data.Fin.Properties.all?, independent of Fin and of any equality.
record Exhaustible {c} (A : Type c) : Typeω where
  field
    all? : ∀ {p} {P : A → Type p} → (∀ x → Dec (P x)) → Dec (∀ x → P x)
```

#### Laws of a single operation

Throughout, `S` is a decidable setoid, `E` an exhaustive-search witness for its
carrier, and `_·_` a bare binary operation on that carrier.

+  Opening `S` exposes the carrier, its setoid equality `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction}, and the
   decidable equality `_≟_`{.AgdaFunction} for `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction};
+  opening `E` exposes the search functional `all?`{.AgdaFunction}.

Each law is then decided by nesting `all?`{.AgdaFunction} over `_≟_`{.AgdaFunction},
one nesting per universally-quantified variable.

```agda
module _ {c ℓ} (S : DecSetoid c ℓ) (E : Exhaustible (DecSetoid.Carrier S)) where
  open DecSetoid S    using ( Carrier ; _≈_ ; _≟_ )
  open Exhaustible E  using ( all? )

  module _ (_·_ : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier) where

    -- a · a ≈ a for every a.
    Idempotent? : Dec (∀ a → a · a ≈ a)
    Idempotent? = all? λ a → a · a ≟ a

    -- a · b ≈ b · a for every a, b.
    Commutative? : Dec (∀ a b → a · b ≈ b · a)
    Commutative? = all? λ a → all? λ b → a · b ≟ b · a

    -- (a · b) · c ≈ a · (b · c) for every a, b, c.
    Associative? : Dec (∀ a b c → (a · b) · c ≈ a · (b · c))
    Associative? = all? λ a → all? λ b → all? λ c → (a · b) · c ≟ a · (b · c)

    module _ (e : Carrier) where

      -- e · a ≈ a for every a.
      LeftIdentity? : Dec (∀ a → e · a ≈ a)
      LeftIdentity? = all? λ a → e · a ≟ a

      -- a · e ≈ a for every a.
      RightIdentity? : Dec (∀ a → a · e ≈ a)
      RightIdentity? = all? λ a → a · e ≟ a

      module _ (i : Carrier → Carrier) where

        -- (i a) · a ≈ e for every a.
        LeftInverse? : Dec (∀ a → (i a) · a ≈ e)
        LeftInverse? = all? λ a → (i a) · a ≟ e

        -- a · (i a) ≈ e for every a.
        RightInverse? : Dec (∀ a → a · (i a) ≈ e)
        RightInverse? = all? λ a → a · (i a) ≟ e
```

#### Laws relating two operations

These take two bare operations `_∧_` and `_∨_` over the same decidable setoid; e.g.,
the meet and join of a lattice.  The shapes match the two-operation checkers
of [Overture.Operations.Properties][] — absorption and distributivity — now stated
over `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction}.

```agda
module _ {c ℓ} (S : DecSetoid c ℓ) (E : Exhaustible (DecSetoid.Carrier S)) where
  open DecSetoid S    using ( Carrier ; _≈_ ; _≟_ )
  open Exhaustible E  using ( all? )

  module _ (_∧_ _∨_ : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier) where

    -- a ∧ (a ∨ b) ≈ a for every a, b.
    Absorbsˡ? : Dec (∀ a b → a ∧ (a ∨ b) ≈ a)
    Absorbsˡ? = all? λ a → all? λ b → a ∧ (a ∨ b) ≟ a

    -- (a ∧ b) ∨ a ≈ a for every a, b.
    Absorbsʳ? : Dec (∀ a b → (a ∧ b) ∨ a ≈ a)
    Absorbsʳ? = all? λ a → all? λ b → (a ∧ b) ∨ a ≟ a

    -- a ∧ (b ∨ c) ≈ (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) for every a, b, c.
    Distributesˡ? : Dec (∀ a b c → a ∧ (b ∨ c) ≈ (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c))
    Distributesˡ? = all? λ a → all? λ b → all? λ c → a ∧ (b ∨ c) ≟ (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)

    -- (b ∨ c) ∧ a ≈ (b ∧ a) ∨ (c ∧ a) for every a, b, c.
    Distributesʳ? : Dec (∀ a b c → (b ∨ c) ∧ a ≈ (b ∧ a) ∨ (c ∧ a))
    Distributesʳ? = all? λ a → all? λ b → all? λ c → (b ∨ c) ∧ a ≟ (b ∧ a) ∨ (c ∧ a)
```

#### The finite instance

`Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype} is exhaustively searchable: its search functional is precisely
`Data.Fin.Properties.all?`.  Wrapping it gives the canonical `Exhaustible`{.AgdaRecord}
witness for `Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype}, the one that recovers the concrete checkers.

```agda
-- The exhaustive-search witness for Fin n, given by all? of Fin.
Fin-Exhaustible : ∀ {n} → Exhaustible (Fin n)
Fin-Exhaustible = record { all? = FinAll? }
```

#### The finite checkers as the propositional instance

Take `S` to be `≡-decSetoid n` — the propositional decidable setoid on
`Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype}, whose `_≈_`{.AgdaFunction} is `_≡_`{.AgdaDatatype} and whose
`_≟_`{.AgdaFunction} is `Data.Fin.Properties._≟_` — and `E` to be
`Fin-Exhaustible`{.AgdaFunction}.

Each generalized checker then *unfolds definitionally* to the corresponding concrete
checker of [Overture.Operations.Properties][]: the search functional reduces to
`all?`{.AgdaFunction} of `Fin` and `_≟_`{.AgdaFunction} reduces to decidable equality
of `Fin`.  We record this as eleven `refl`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor} equations, one
per checker.

This is the precise sense in which the concrete checkers *are* the propositional
instance of the generalized ones — and, because the equalities are definitional, the
concrete checkers keep reducing exactly as before for `from-yes`{.AgdaFunction}, so
the finite examples are unaffected.

(Each equation is stated as an anonymous definition: it exists only to confirm, at
type-checking time, that the identity holds, and is not meant to be named or
referenced elsewhere.)

```agda
module _ {n : ℕ} (_·_ : Fin n → Fin n → Fin n) where

  _ : Concrete.Idempotent? _·_ ≡ Idempotent? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _·_
  _ = refl

  _ : Concrete.Commutative? _·_ ≡ Commutative? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _·_
  _ = refl

  _ : Concrete.Associative? _·_ ≡ Associative? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _·_
  _ = refl

  module _ (e : Fin n) where

    _ : Concrete.LeftIdentity? _·_ e ≡ LeftIdentity? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _·_ e
    _ = refl

    _ : Concrete.RightIdentity? _·_ e ≡ RightIdentity? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _·_ e
    _ = refl

    module _ (i : Fin n → Fin n) where

      _ : Concrete.LeftInverse? _·_ e i ≡ LeftInverse? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _·_ e i
      _ = refl

      _ : Concrete.RightInverse? _·_ e i ≡ RightInverse? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _·_ e i
      _ = refl

module _ {n : ℕ} (_∧_ _∨_ : Fin n → Fin n → Fin n) where

  _ : Concrete.Absorbsˡ? _∧_ _∨_ ≡ Absorbsˡ? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _∧_ _∨_
  _ = refl

  _ : Concrete.Absorbsʳ? _∧_ _∨_ ≡ Absorbsʳ? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _∧_ _∨_
  _ = refl

  _ : Concrete.Distributesˡ? _∧_ _∨_ ≡ Distributesˡ? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _∧_ _∨_
  _ = refl

  _ : Concrete.Distributesʳ? _∧_ _∨_ ≡ Distributesʳ? (≡-decSetoid n) Fin-Exhaustible _∧_ _∨_
  _ = refl
```

#### A non-Fin instance: the two-element Boolean setoid

To exercise the generality on a carrier that is *not* `Fin n`{.AgdaDatatype}, we
supply an exhaustive-search witness for `Bool`{.AgdaDatatype} directly and run the
checkers over the propositional decidable setoid on `Bool`{.AgdaDatatype}.  Searching
`Bool`{.AgdaDatatype} is immediate: `∀ b → P b` holds iff both `P false` and `P true`
do, so a pointwise decider for `P` decides the universal by a single
`_×-dec_`{.AgdaFunction}.  This both demonstrates the abstraction and previews, in
miniature, the kind of witness an M9-1 `Searchable` carrier would provide
generically.  The section is `private`{.AgdaKeyword}: it validates the generalization
without enlarging the module's public surface.

```agda
private

  -- Bool is exhaustively searchable: ∀ b → P b reduces to P false and P true.
  Bool-Exhaustible : Exhaustible Bool
  Bool-Exhaustible = record { all? = bool-all? }
    where
    bool-all? : ∀ {p} {P : Bool → Type p} → (∀ b → Dec (P b)) → Dec (∀ b → P b)
    bool-all? {P = P} P? = map′ to from (P? false ×-dec P? true)
      where
      to : P false × P true → (∀ b → P b)
      to (pf , _ ) false = pf
      to ( _ , pt) true  = pt
      from : (∀ b → P b) → P false × P true
      from p = p false , p true
```

The generalized checkers now decide the Boolean-lattice laws of conjunction and
disjunction directly over `Bool`{.AgdaDatatype}, with no detour through
`Fin 2`{.AgdaDatatype}.  Each proof is extracted by `from-yes`{.AgdaFunction} from the
generalized decision; a wrong claim would make the decision compute to
`no`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor} and fail to type-check, just as in the finite
examples.

```agda
  -- Conjunction is idempotent, commutative, and associative on Bool, and absorbs
  -- disjunction — each decided by the generalized checkers at the Bool setoid.
  ∧-idem-bool : ∀ a → a ∧ a ≡ a
  ∧-idem-bool = from-yes (Idempotent? BoolP.≡-decSetoid Bool-Exhaustible _∧_)

  ∧-comm-bool : ∀ a b → a ∧ b ≡ b ∧ a
  ∧-comm-bool = from-yes (Commutative? BoolP.≡-decSetoid Bool-Exhaustible _∧_)

  ∧-assoc-bool : ∀ a b c → (a ∧ b) ∧ c ≡ a ∧ (b ∧ c)
  ∧-assoc-bool = from-yes (Associative? BoolP.≡-decSetoid Bool-Exhaustible _∧_)

  ∧-absorbs-∨-bool : ∀ a b → a ∧ (a ∨ b) ≡ a
  ∧-absorbs-∨-bool = from-yes (Absorbsˡ? BoolP.≡-decSetoid Bool-Exhaustible _∧_ _∨_)
```
