### The Finite Lattice Representation Problem

This is the [FLRP][] module of the [Agda Universal Algebra Library][].

This top-level `FLRP/` tree hosts the library's research program on the
**Finite Lattice Representation Problem**: is every finite lattice isomorphic to the
congruence lattice of a *finite* algebra?

The program's plan (the state of the art, the primary avenue of attack via
interval-enforceable properties, and the breakdown into work packages) lives in
[`docs/notes/flrp-research-roadmap.md`](docs/notes/flrp-research-roadmap.md).

The `FLRP/` tree holds only problem-specific formal content, while reusable
mathematics developed along the way (group actions, subgroup lattices, closure
combinatorics) lives in the `Setoid/`, `Classical/`, and `Order/` trees.

Two standing warnings apply to everything under this namespace.

+  **Research-track separation**.  The FLRP is distinct from the algebraic-complexity
   / finite-CSP track and from the Maltsev and interpretability infrastructure, even
   where they share modules.
+  **Experimental status**.  FLRP modules are research material and are exempt from
   the stable-API deprecation discipline until their results stabilize.

**Current submodules**.

+  [FLRP.Problem][] — the representability predicate `Representable`, the
   formal statement of the problem, the first worked instance (the one-element
   chain), and the constructive no-go theorem for the two-element chain.
+  [FLRP.Enforceable][] — group representability of a lattice, the
   interval-enforceability classification (IE, cf-IE, min-IE), the fattening
   isomorphism `[H × K, G × K] ≅ [H, G]`, the no-contradictory-IE theorem
   (the research note's Lemma 3.2), and hypothesis-parameterized statements of
   Lemma 3.1 and the parachute meta-theorem.
+  [FLRP.Bridge][] — the easy (constructive) direction of the Pálfy–Pudlák
   correspondence, at both layers: the Layer-S order isomorphism
   `Con (𝒢 ↷ 𝒢/H) ≅ [H, 𝒢]` between the semantic congruence lattice of the
   transitive G-set of cosets and the respecting upper interval in the subgroup
   lattice, and its Layer-D counterpart `DecCon (𝒢 ↷ 𝒢/H) ≅ [H, 𝒢]ᵈ` over the
   decidably presented interval (`bridgeᵈ`), proved directly with no classical
   assumption, together with the representability corollaries — in particular
   `GroupRepresentable→Representableᵈ`: every group-representable lattice is
   decidably representable (issue #454).
+  [FLRP.Representable][] — the Layer-D reformulation of the problem:
   decidable representability `Representableᵈ`, the statement
   `FLRP-Statementᵈ`, and the constructive two-element-chain representation
   `chain₂-Representableᵈ` (the object the no-go theorem forbids at Layer S,
   attained here with no postulate).
+  [FLRP.Assumptions][] — the registry of classical theorems imported as
   explicit hypotheses (never postulates), keeping the tree honest under
   `--safe`; its first entry is the congruence-completeness bridge
   `CongruenceCompleteness`, the single Layer-S→Layer-D assumption of ADR-008.
+  [FLRP.LayerBridge][] — the cross-layer bridge: under the congruence-completeness
   assumption, the semantic and decidable congruence posets are order-isomorphic
   (`conDecIso`), whence `Representable 𝑳 ↔ Representableᵈ 𝑳`.
+  [FLRP.Certificates][] — machine-checked representation certificates: the
   assembly turning a checked whole-lattice certificate (Freese traces and
   pointer tables, verified search-free by the
   `Setoid.Congruences.Certificates` checkers) into a `Representableᵈ` witness
   for the target lattice, so external searches (GAP, UACalc, SAT) enter the
   corpus only through the checker.

**Planned submodules** (per § 6 of the roadmap).

+  `FLRP.Closure` (closure properties of the representable class);
+  `FLRP.Intervals` (intervals in subgroup lattices and core-free normalization);
+  `FLRP.Reductions` (the catalog of reduction theorems).
