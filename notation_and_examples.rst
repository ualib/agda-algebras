Notation and Examples

Notation
---------

Throughout, we denote and define the natural numbers as the following sets

.. math:: 0 := ∅, \quad 1 := \{0\}, \quad 2 := \{0, 1\}, \quad \dots, \quad n := \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\}, \quad\dots

However, as this notation is known to cause confusion, we often remind the reader that the number :math:`n` should be viewed as a set by setting it in boldface; that is, we often write 𝐧 to denote the set :math:`\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}`.

We will denote the set of natural numbers by ω or ℕ, and we write :math:`n<ω` (or :math:`n∈ ℕ`, or :math:`n:ℕ`) to indicate that :math:`n` is a natural number.

We write :math:`i<n` (or :math:`i∈ 𝐧`, or :math:`i:𝐧`) to indicate that :math:`i` belongs to the set :math:`\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}`.

The Cartesian product of objects :math:`A_0, A_1, \dots, A_{n-1}` is denoted by :math:`∏_𝐧 A_i := A_0 × \cdots × A_{n-1}`.

An element :math:`𝐚 ∈ ∏_𝐧 A_i` is an ordered :math:`n`-tuple, which may be specified by its graph, :math:`(𝐚(0), 𝐚(1), \dots, 𝐚(n-1))`.

Thus, tuples are functions defined on a (finite) index set, and this view may be emphasized symbolically as follows:

.. math:: 𝐚: 𝐧 → ⋃_𝐧 A_i; \ i↦ 𝐚(i) ∈ A_i.

If :math:`σ: 𝐤 → 𝐧` is a :math:`k`-tuple of numbers from 𝐧, then we can compose an n-tuple :math:`𝐚 ∈ ∏_𝐧 A_i` with σ to obtain the k-tuple :math:`𝐚 ∘ σ ∈ ∏_𝐤 A_{σ(i)}`.

Generally speaking, we will try to avoid nonstandard notational conventions, but here are two exceptions: let

.. math:: 𝐀 := ∏_𝐧 A_i \quad \text{ and } \quad 𝐀_σ := ∏_𝐤 A_{σ(i)}.

Now, if the k-tuple σ: 𝐤 → 𝐧 happens to be one-to-one, and if we let :math:`p_σ` denote the map 𝐚 ↦ 𝐚 ∘ σ, then :math:`p_σ` is the usual :term:`projection operation` from 𝐀 onto :math:`𝐀_σ`.

Thus, :math:`p_σ(𝐚)` is a k-tuple whose i-th component is (𝐚 ∘ σ)(i) = 𝐚(σ(i)).

We will make frequent use of such projections, as well as their images under the covariant and contravariant powerset functors 𝒫 and :math:`𝒫^{\leftarrow}`.

Indeed, we let :math:`\mathrm{Proj}_σ: 𝒫(𝐀) → 𝒫(𝐀_σ)` denote the **projection set function** defined for each :math:`R ⊆ 𝐀` by

.. math:: \mathrm{Proj}_σ R = 𝒫 (p_σ)(R) = \{p_σ(𝐱) ∣ 𝐱 ∈ R\} = \{𝐱 ∘ σ ∣ 𝐱 ∈ R\},

and we let :math:`\mathrm{Inj}_σ: 𝒫^←(𝐀_σ) → 𝒫^←(𝐀)` denote the **injection set function** defined for each :math:`S ⊆ 𝐀_σ` by

.. math:: \mathrm{Inj}_σ S = 𝒫^←(p_σ)(S) = \{𝐱 ∣ p_σ(𝐱) ∈ S\} = \{𝐱 ∈ 𝐀 ∣ 𝐱 ∘ σ ∈ S\}.
   :label: 19

Of course, :math:`\mathrm{Inj}_σ S` is nothing more than the inverse image of the set :math:`S` with respect to the projection function :math:`p_σ`.

We sometimes use the shorthand :math:`R_σ := \mathrm{Proj}_σ R` and :math:`S^{\overleftarrow{σ}} = \mathrm{Inj}_σ S` for the projection and injection set functions, respectively.

Examples of algebras
----------------------

Recall from above that an algebra :math:`𝔸` is an ordered pair :math:`𝔸 = ⟨A, F^𝔸⟩` where :math:`A` is a nonempty set and :math:`F` is a family of finitary operations on :math:`A`.

The set :math:`A` is called the **universe** of :math:`𝔸`, and the elements :math:`f^𝔸 ∈ F` are called the **basic operations** of :math:`𝔸`.

(In practice we often write :math:`f` instead of :math:`f^𝔸` when no ambiguity could result from this shorthand.

Here is a list of a few of the most frequently encountered and historically important algebraic structures. [1]_

.. glossary:: 

   magma
     An algebra :math:`⟨A, ⋅⟩` with a single binary operation is called a **magma** (or **groupoid** or **binar**). The operation is usually denoted by :math:`+` or :math:`⋅`, and we write :math:`a+b` or :math:`a ⋅ b` (or just :math:`ab`) for the image of :math:`(a, b)` under this operation, which we call the *sum* or *product* of :math:`a` and :math:`b`, respectively.

   semigroup
     A magma :math:`⟨A, ⋅⟩` whose binary operation is associative is called a **semigroup**.  That is, a semigroup is a magma whose binary operation satisfies :math:`∀ a, b, c ∈ A`, :math:`(a ⋅ b) ⋅ c = a ⋅ (b ⋅ c)`.

   monoid
     If :math:`⟨A, ⋅⟩` is a semigroup and if :math:`e ∈ A` is a *multiplicative identity* (i.e., :math:`∀ a ∈ A`, :math:`e ⋅ a = a ⋅ e = a`), then :math:`⟨A, \{e, ⋅\}⟩` is called a **monoid**.

   group
     A **group** is a monoid along with a unary operation :math:`^{-1}` called *multiplicative inverse*. That is, the reduct :math:`⟨ A, \{e, ⋅\}⟩` is a monoid and :math:`^{-1}` satisfies :math:`a ⋅ a^{-1} =  a^{-1} ⋅ a = e`, for all :math:`a ∈ A`.
  
   Abelian group
     A group is called **abelian** just in case its binary operation is commutative, in which case we usually denote the operation by :math:`+` instead of :math:`⋅`. Also in this case we let :math:`0` (instead of :math:`e`) denote the *additive identity*, and we let :math:`-\,` (instead of :math:`^{-1}`) denote the *additive inverse*. Thus, an **abelian group** is a group :math:`𝔸 = ⟨ A, 0, -,+⟩` such that :math:`a+b = b+a` for all :math:`a, b ∈ A`.

   ring
     An algebra :math:`⟨R, \{0, -, +, ⋅\}⟩` is called a **ring** just in case the following conditions hold:

       #. the reduct :math:`⟨R, \{0, -,+\}⟩` is an abelian group,
       #. the reduct :math:`⟨R, ⋅ ⟩` is a semigroup, and
       #. "multiplication" :math:`⋅` distributes over "addition" :math:`+`; that is, :math:`∀ a, b, c ∈ R`, :math:`a ⋅ (b+c) = a ⋅ b + a ⋅ c` and :math:`(a+b)⋅ c = a ⋅ c + b ⋅ c`.

     A **ring with unity** (or **unital ring**) is an algebra :math:`⟨R, \{0, 1, -, +, ⋅\}⟩` with a ring reduct :math:`⟨R, \{0, -, +, ⋅\}⟩` and a *multiplicative identity* :math:`1 ∈ R`; that is :math:`∀ r ∈ R`, :math:`r ⋅ 1 = r = 1 ⋅ r`.

     If :math:`⟨R, \{0, 1, -, +, ⋅\}⟩` is a unital ring, an element :math:`r ∈ R` is called a **unit** if it has a multiplicative inverse, that is, there exists :math:`s ∈ R` with :math:`r ⋅ s = 1 = s ⋅ r`.  (We usually denote such an :math:`s` by :math:`r^{-1}`.)

   division ring
     A ring in which every non-zero element is a unit is called a **division ring**.

   field
     A commutative division ring is called a **field**.

   module
     Let :math:`R` be a ring with unit. A **left unitary** :math:`R`-**module** (or simply :math:`R`-**module**) is an algebra :math:`⟨M, \{0, -, +\} ∪ \{f_r : r∈ R\}⟩` with an abelian group reduct :math:`⟨M, \{0, -, +\}⟩` and unary operations :math:`\{f_r : r ∈ R\}` that satisfy the following: :math:`∀ r, s ∈ R`, :math:`∀ x, y ∈ M`,

       #. :math:`f_r(x + y)  = f_r(x) + f_r(y)`
       #. :math:`f_{r+s}(x) = f_r(x) + f_s(x)`
       #. :math:`f_r(f_s(x)) = f_{rs}(x)`
       #. :math:`f_1(x) = x`.

     Note that Condition 1 says that each :math:`f_r` is an :term:`endomorphism` of the abelian group :math:`⟨ M, \{0, -, +\}⟩`, while the other conditions amount to the following: (1) the set :math:`E := \{f_r ∣ r∈ R\}` of endomorphisms is a ring with unit where multiplication is function composition, and (2) the map :math:`r ↦ f_r` is a ring :term:`epimorphism` from :math:`R` onto :math:`E`.

     One reason modules are important is that every ring is, up to isomorphism, a ring of endomorphisms of some abelian group. This fact is analogous to the more familiar theorem of Cayley stating that every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations of some set.

   vector space
     In :math:`R` happens to be a field, then an :math:`R`-module is typically called a **vector space** over :math:`R`.

   bilinear algebra
     If :math:`𝔽 = ⟨F, \{0, 1, -, ⋅\}⟩` is a field, then the algebra :math:`𝔸 = ⟨A, \{0, -, +, ⋅\} ∪ \{f_r ∣ r ∈ F\}⟩` is called a **bilinear algebra** over :math:`𝔽` provided

       #. :math:`⟨A, \{0, -, +\} ∪ \{f_r ∣ r ∈ F\}⟩` is a vector space over :math:`𝔽` and 
       #. :math:`∀ a, b, c ∈ A`, :math:`∀ r ∈ F`,

       .. math:: \begin{gather}
                 (a + b) ⋅ c = (a ⋅ c) + (b ⋅ c),\\
                 c ⋅ (a + b) = (c ⋅ a) + (c ⋅ b),\\
                 a ⋅ f_r(b) = f_r(a ⋅ b) = f_r(a) ⋅ b.
                 \end{gather}

     If in addition :math:`(a ⋅ b) ⋅ c = a ⋅ (b ⋅ c)` for all :math:`a, b, c ∈ A`, then :math:`𝔸` is called an **associative algebra** over :math:`𝔽`. Thus an associative algebra over a field has both a vector space reduct and a ring reduct. An example of an associative algebra is the space of *linear transformations* (endomorphisms) of any vector space into itself.
