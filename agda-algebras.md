# The Agda Universal Algebra Library

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Version 2.04 of {{ "now" | date: "%d %b %Y" }})

**Abstract**. The [Agda Universal Algebra Library][] is a collection of types and
programs (theorems and proofs) that formalizes the foundations of universal
algebra in dependent type theory using the [Agda][] proof assistant language.

The library contains definitions of many new types for representing important
constructs and theorems comprising a substantial part of the foundations of
general (universal) algebra and equational logic. These types are implemented in
so called "literate" Agda files (with the `.lagda` extension), and they are
grouped into modules which can be easily imported and integrated into other Agda
developments.

To get an idea of the current scope of the library, note that it now includes a
formal proof of Birkhoff's [HSP
Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(universal_algebra)#Birkhoff's_theorem),
which asserts that every *variety* is an *equational class*.  That is, if ùí¶ is a
class of algebras which is closed under the taking of homomorphic images,
subalgebras, and arbitrary products, then ùí¶ is the class of all algebras
satisfying some set of identities. To our knowledge, ours is the first formal,
machine-checked proof of Birkhoff's Theorem. (If you have evidence refuting this
claim, we would love to hear about it; please [email
us](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com)!)

We hope the library is useful to mathematicians and computer scientists who wish
to formalize their work in dependent type theory and verify their results with a
proof assistant. Indeed, the [agda-algebras][] library aims to become an indispensable
companion on our mathematical journeys, helping us authenticate the discoveries we
make along the way.

## Organization

We have organized the library into two main modules, called [Base](Base.html) and
[Setoid](Setoid.html), which are imported below (after the [Preface][] module,
which contains no Agda code).  These two modules are mostly independent of one
another.  The [Base](Base.html) module contains submodules that comprise the first
version of the library.  The [Setoid](Setoid.html) contains an alternative version
of the library that is based on setoids.  Finally, we have begun work on a third
alternative version of the library, called `cubical-agda-algebras`, based on
Cubical Agda.

## The formalization of Birkhoff's Theorem

The [Demos.HSP][] module presents a fairly self-contained formal proof of
Birkhoff's HSP Theorem in a single module.

An earlier version of the proof is described in the [Birkhoff HSP Theorem
Section](https://ualib.org/Setoid.Varieties.HSP.html#proof-of-the-hsp-theorem) of
the documentation; specifically, see [Setoid.Varieties.HSP][].

The source code containing the complete formal proof of Birkhoff's Theorem is
available in the [agda-algebras][] GitHub repository; see [Demos/HSP.lagda][] or
[Setoid/Varieties/HSP.lagda][].
