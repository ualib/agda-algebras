\begin{abstract}
The Agda Universal Algebra Library (\ualib) is a library of types and programs (theorems and proofs) we developed to formalize the foundations of universal algebra in Martin-Löf dependent type theory using the \agda programming language and proof assistant. This paper describes the UALib and demonstrates how it makes Agda more accessible to working mathematicians (like ourselves) as a tool for formally verifying ``known'' results in general algebra and related fields, as well as for discovering new theorems in these areas.  The library already includes a substantial collection of definitions, theorems, and proofs from universal algebra and as such provides many examples that exhibit the power of inductive and dependent types for representing and reasoning about algebraic and relational structures.

The first major milestone of the \ualib project is a complete proof of Birkhoff's HSP Theorem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time Birkhoff's Theorem has been formulated and proved in dependent type theory and verified with a proof assistant.

In this paper we describe the UALib and the formal proof of Birkhoff's theorem, discussing some of the challenges we faced and how these hurdles were overcome. In so doing, we illustrate the effectiveness of dependent type theory, Agda, and the UALib for proving and verifying theorems in universal algebra.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
To support formalization in type theory of research level mathematics in universal algebra and related fields, we present the Agda Universal Algebra Library (\agdaualib), a software library containing formal statements and proofs of the core definitions and results of universal algebra. 
The \agdaualib is written in \agda~\cite{Norell:2009}, a programming language and proof assistant based on Martin-L\"of Type Theory that not only supports dependent and inductive types, but also provides powerful \emph{proof tactics} for proving things about the objects that inhabit these types.

There have been a number of prior efforts to formalize parts of universal algebra in type theory, most notably
\begin{itemize}
  \item Capretta~\cite{Capretta:1999} (1999) formalized the basics of universal algebra in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions using the Coq proof assistant;
    \item Spitters and van der Weegen~\cite{Spitters:2011} (2011) formalized the basics of universal algebra and some classical algebraic structures, also in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions using the Coq proof assistant, promoting the use of type classes as a preferable alternative to setoids;
 \item Gunther, et al~\cite{Gunther:2018} developed what seems to be (prior to the \ualib) the most extensive library of formal universal algebra to date; in particular, this work includes a formalization of some basic equational logic; the project (like the \ualib) uses Martin-L\"of dependent type theory and the Agda proof assistant.
\end{itemize}
Some other projects aimed at formalizing mathematics generally, and algebra in particular, have developed into very extensive libraries that include definitions, theorems, and proofs about algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, fields, and modules.  However, the goals of this prior work seems to be a formal library of definitions, theorems, and proofs about specific classical algebraic structures, as opposed to the general theory of (universal) algebras.

Although the \agdaualib project was initiated relatively recently (in 2018), the part of universal algebra and equational logic that it formalizes already extends beyond the scope of prior efforts.  In particular, the \ualib now includes the only formal, constructive, machine-checked proof of Birkhoff's variety theorem that we know of. We remark that, with the exception of~\cite{Carlstrom:2008}, all other proofs of Birkhoff's theorem we have seen are informal and not known to be constructive.

%% \subsection{Vision and Goals}\label{vision-and-goals}
The seminal idea for the \agdaualib project was the observation that, on the one hand, a number of fundamental constructions in universal algebra can be defined recursively, and theorems about them proved by structural induction, while, on the other hand, inductive and dependent types make possible very precise formal representations of recursively defined objects, which often admit elegant constructive proofs of properties of such objects.  An important feature of such proofs in type theory is that they are total functional programs and, as such, they are computable and composable.  These observations suggested that there would be much to gain from implementing universal algebra in a language, such as Martin-L\"of type theory, that features dependent and inductive types.

Futhermore, our own research experience has taught us that a proof assistant and programming language (like Agda), when equipped with specialized libraries and domain-specific tactics to automate proof idioms of a particular field, can be an extremely powerful and effective asset. We believe that such libraries, and the proof assistants they support, ought to become indispensable tools in the working mathematician's toolkit.

\subsection{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
Apart from the library itself, we describes the formal implementation and proof of a deep result, Garrett Birkhoff's celebrated HSP Theorem~\cite{Birkhoff:1935}, which was among the first major results of universal algebra.  The theorem states that a \defn{variety} (a class of algebras closed under quotients, subalgebras, and products) is an equational class.  More precisely, a class 𝒦 of algebras is closed under the taking of quotients, subalgebras, and arbitrary products if and only if 𝒦 is the class of algebras satisfying a certain set of equations.

The fact that we now have a formal proof of Birkhoff's Theorem in Agda is noteworthy, not only because this is the first time the theorem has been proved in dependent type theory and verified with a proof assistant, but also because our proof is \emph{constructive}. As the paper~\cite{Carlstrom:2008} of Carlstr\"om makes clear, it is a highly nontrivial exercise to take a well-known informal proof of a theorem like Birkhoff's and to show that it can be formalized using only constructive logic and natural deduction, without appealing to, say, the Law of the Excluded Middle or the Axiom of Choice.

%% Prelude %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

This section describes some of the more important parts of the \agdaualib module called \ualibPreliminaries, which imports everything we need from Martin Escardo's \typetopology library~\cite{MHE}, defines some other basic types and proves some of their properties.  We will not cover very much of the entire Preliminaries module here. Instead, we merely call attention to those aspects that might differ from standard Agda syntax or cause confusion in the sequel. For more details, see~\cite[\S2.1]{DeMeo:2021}.

%%--BEGIN: \input{Preliminaries-short.tex}-----------------------------------------------

%% \noindent \textbf{Notation}. Here are some acronyms that we use frequently.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \tightlist
%% \item \mhe = \MHE
%% \item \mltt = \MLTT
%% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Options and imports}\label{ssec:options-and-imports}
Agda programs typically begin by setting some options and by importing from existing libraries.
Options are specified with the \AgdaKeyword{OPTIONS} \emph{pragma} and control the way Agda behaves by, for example, specifying which logical foundations should be assumed when the program is type-checked to verify its correctness.  
Agda programs in the \ualib reside in \texttt{.lagda} files, and every one of them begins with the pragma
\ccpad
\begin{code}[number=code:options]
\>[0]\AgdaSymbol{\{-\#}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaKeyword{OPTIONS}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaPragma{--without-K}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaPragma{--exact-split}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaPragma{--safe}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaSymbol{\#-\}}\<%
\end{code}
\ccpad
This has the following effects:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \texttt{without-K} disables \axiomk; see~\cite{agdaref-axiomk};
\item
  \texttt{exact-split} makes Agda accept only definitions that are \emph{judgmental} or \emph{definitional} equalities. As \escardo explains, this ``makes sure that pattern matching corresponds to Martin-Löf eliminators;'' for more details see~\cite{agdatools-patternmatching};
\item
  \texttt{safe} ensures that nothing is postulated outright---every non-MLTT axiom has to be an explicit assumption (e.g., an argument to a function or module); see~\cite{agdaref-safeagda} and~\cite{agdatools-patternmatching}.
\end{enumerate}
In the remainder of this paper, we take assumptions 1--3 for granted without mentioning them explicitly.

%% \subsection{Imports from Type Topology}\label{imports-from-type-topology}
The \agdaualib adopts the notation of the \typetopology library. In particular, universes are denoted by capitalized script letters from the second half of the alphabet, e.g., \ab 𝓤, \ab 𝓥, \ab 𝓦, \ab 𝓧, \ab 𝓨, \ab 𝓩, etc. Also defined in the \typetopology library are the operators~\af ̇~and~\af ⁺. These map a universe \ab 𝓤 to \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ := \Set \ab 𝓤 and \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺ \aod := \lsuc \ab 𝓤, respectively.  Thus, \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ is simply an alias for \Set \ab 𝓤, and we have \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ \as : (\ab 𝓤 \af ⁺) \af ̇.
%% The level \lzero is renamed \AgdaBound{𝓤₀}, so \AgdaBound{𝓤₀}\af ̇ is an alias for \Set \lzero.\footnote{For those familiar the \href{https://leanprover.github.io/}{Lean} proof assistant, \AgdaBound{𝓤₀}\af ̇ (i.e., \Set \lzero) is analogous to Lean's \texttt{Sort 0}.}
Table~\ref{tab:dictionary} translates between standard \agda syntax and \mhe/\ualib notation.\footnote{To justify the introduction of this somewhat nonstandard notation for universe levels, \escardo points out that the Agda library uses \AgdaKeyword{Level} for universes (so what we write as \ab 𝓤 ̇ is written \Set\sP{3}\ab 𝓤 in standard Agda), but in univalent mathematics the types in \ab 𝓤 ̇ need not be sets, so the standard Agda notation can be misleading.}


\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
Standard \agda                        &          \mhe/\ualib \\
\hline
\AgdaKeyword{Level}          &   \AgdaFunction{Universe}\\
\ab 𝓤 : \AgdaKeyword{Level}  & \ab 𝓤 : \AgdaFunction{Universe}\\
\Set \ab 𝓤                  &       \ab 𝓤 ̇ \\
\lsuc \ab 𝓤                   &    \ab 𝓤 ⁺\\
\Set (\lsuc \ab 𝓤) &    \ab 𝓤 ⁺ ̇\\
\lzero                       &         \AgdaBound{𝓤₀}\\
\AgdaFunction{Setω}  &         \AgdaFunction{𝓤ω}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Special notation for universe levels}
\label{tab:dictionary}
\end{table}

There will be many occasions calling for a the universe that is the least upper bound of two universes, say, \ab 𝓤  and \ab 𝓥. This is denoted by \ab 𝓤 \AgdaSymbol{⊔} \ab 𝓥, and the correponding type is (\ab 𝓤 \AgdaSymbol{⊔} \ab 𝓥) ̇, or, more simply, \ab 𝓤 \AgdaSymbol{⊔} \ab 𝓥 ̇ (since \AgdaUnderscore{}\AgdaSymbol{⊔}\AgdaUnderscore{} has higher precedence than \AgdaUnderscore{}̇).

\subsection{Dependent pairs and projections}\label{ssec:dependent-pairs-and-projections}
Given universes \ab 𝓤 and \ab 𝓥, a type \ab X \as : \ab 𝓤 \aof ̇, and a type family \ab Y \as : X \as → \ab 𝓥 \aof ̇, the \defn{Sigma type} (or \defn{dependent pair type}) is denoted by \AgdaRecord{Σ}(\ab x \as ꞉ \ab X)\as ,\ab Y(\ab x) and generalizes the Cartesian product \ab X \as × \ab Y by allowing the type \ab Y(\ab x) of the second argument of the ordered pair (\ab x\as , \ab y) to depend on the value \ab x of the first.  That is, \AgdaRecord{Σ}(\ab x \as ꞉ \ab X)\as ,\ab Y(\ab x) is inhabited by pairs (\ab x\as , \ab y) such that \ab x \as : \ab X and \ab y \as : \ab Y(\ab x).

Agda's default syntax for a Sigma type is \AgdaRecord{Σ}\sP{3}\AgdaSymbol{λ}(\ab x\sP{3}꞉\sP{3}\ab X)\sP{3}\as →\sP{3}\ab Y, but we prefer the notation \AgdaRecord{Σ}~\ab x~꞉~\ab X~,~\ab Y, which is closer to the standard syntax described in the preceding paragraph. Fortunately, this preferred notation is available in the \typetopology library (see~\cite[Σ types]{MHE}).\footnote{The symbol \as ꞉ in the expression \AgdaRecord{Σ}\sP{3}\ab x\sP{3}\as ꞉\sP{3}\ab X\sP{3}\AgdaComma\sP{3}\ab Y is not the ordinary colon (:); rather, it is the symbol obtained by typing \texttt{\textbackslash{}:4} in \agdatwomode.} 

\newcommand\FstUnder{\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{∣\AgdaUnderscore{}∣}}\xspace}
\newcommand\SndUnder{\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{∥\AgdaUnderscore{}∥}}\xspace}
Convenient notations for the first and second projections out of a product are \FstUnder and \SndUnder, respectively. However, to improve readability or to avoid notation clashes with other modules, we sometimes use more standard alternatives, such as \AgdaFunction{pr₁} and \AgdaFunction{pr₂}, or \AgdaFunction{fst} and \AgdaFunction{snd}, or some combination of these. The definitions are standard so we omit them (but see~\cite[\S2.1.5]{DeMeo:2021} for details).

\subsection{Equality}\label{ssec:equality}
Perhaps the most important types in type theory are the equality types. The \emph{definitional equality} we use is a standard one and is often referred to as ``reflexivity'' or ``refl''.  In our case, it is defined in the Identity-Type module of the \TypeTopology library, but apart from syntax it is equivalent to the identity type used in most other Agda libraries. Here is the definition.

\subsubsection{Truncation and h-sets}\label{sssec:truncation-and-hsets}
In general, we may have many inhabitants of a given type, hence (via Curry-Howard correspondence) many proofs of a given proposition. For instance, suppose we have a type \ab X and an identity relation \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} on \ab X so that, given two inhabitants of \ab X, say, \ab a\AgdaSpace{}\ab b \as : \ab X, we can form the type \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b. Suppose \ab p and \ab q inhabit the type \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b; that is, \ab p and \ab q are proofs of \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b, in which case we write \ab p \ab q : \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b. Then we might wonder whether and in what sense are the two proofs \ab p and \ab q the ``same.'' We are asking about an identity type on the identity type \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}}, and whether there is some inhabitant \ab r of this type; i.e., whether there is a proof \ab r : \ab p \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ₁}} \ab q.  If such a proof exists for all \ab p \ab q : \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b, then we say that the proof of \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b is \emph{unique}. As a property of the types \ab X and \aod{≡ₓ}, this is sometimes called \emph{uniqueness of identity proofs}.

Perhaps we have two proofs, say, \ab r \ab s : \ab p \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ₁}} \ab q. Then it is natural to wonder whether \ab r \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ₂}} \ab s has a proof!  However, we may decide that at some level the potential to distinguish two proofs of an identity in a meaningful way (so-called \emph{proof relevance}) is not useful or interesting. At that point, say, at level \ab k, we might assume that there is at most one proof of any identity of the form \ab p  \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓₖ}} \ab q. This is called \emph{truncation}.
%% \href{https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/HoTT-UF-Agda.html#truncation}{truncation}.

In \emph{homotopy type theory}~\cite{HoTT:2013}, a type \ab X with an identity relation \AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ} is called an \defn{h-set} (or \defn{0-groupoid} or \defn{set}) if for every pair \ab a \ab b \as : \ab X of elements of type \ab X there is at most one proof of \ab a \AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ} \ab b.

\subsubsection{Function extensionality and intensionality}\label{sssec:function-extensionality-and-intensionality}
Extensional equality of functions, or \emph{function extensionality}, is a principle that is often assumed in the \agdaualib. It asserts that two point-wise equal functions are equal,\footnote{This is known to be not provable or disprovable in Martin-Löf type theory. It is an independent statement.} and is defined in the \typetopology library in the following natural way:

Pointwise equality of functions is typically what one means in informal settings when one says that two functions are equal. Later we will need dependent and polymorphic notions of function extensionality, and these are defined in the \ualib and \typetopology libraries (see~\cite[\S2.4]{DeMeo:2021} and~\cite[\S17-18]{MHE}).

\defn{Function intensionality} is the opposite of function extensionality and it comes in handy whenever we have a definitional equality and need a point-wise equality.

Of course, the intensionality principle has dependent and polymorphic analogues defined in the \agdaualib, but we omit the definitions. (See~\cite[\S2.4]{DeMeo:2021} for details).
















\section{Inverses, Epics and Monics}\label{ssec:inverses}
This section describes some of the more important parts of the \ualibInverses module.
In \S~\ref{ssec:inverse-image-type}, we define an inductive datatype that represents our semantic notion of the \defn{inverse image} of a function. In \S~\ref{ssec:epic-and-monic-function-types} we define types for \defn{epic} and \defn{monic} functions. Finally, in Subsections~\ref{ssec:monics-are-set-embeddings}, we consider the type of \defn{embeddings} (defined in~\cite[\S26]{MHE}), and determine how this type relates to our type of monic functions.

Note that an inhabitant of \af{Image} \ab f \ad ∋ \ab b is a dependent pair (\ab a \ac \ab p), where \ab a \as : \ab A and \ab p \as : \ab b  \ad ≡ \ab f \ab a is a proof that \ab f maps \ab a to \ab b. Thus, a proof that \ab b belongs to the image of \ab f (i.e., an inhabitant of \af{Image} \ab f \ad ∋ \ab b), is always accompanied by a witness \ab a \as : \ab A, and a proof that \ab b \ad{≡} \ab f \ab a, so the inverse of a function \ab f can actually be \emph{computed} at every inhabitant of the image of \ab f.

We define an inverse function, which we call \af{Inv}, which, when given \ab b \as : \ab B and a proof (\ab a \ac \ab p) \as : \af{Image} \ab f \ad ∋ \ab b that \ab b belongs to the image of \ab f, produces \ab a (a preimage of \ab b under \ab f).

Thus, the inverse is computed by pattern matching on the structure of the third explicit argument, which has (inductive) type \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{Image}}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{f}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{∋}}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{b}.  Since there are two constructors, \AgdaInductiveConstructor{im} and \AgdaInductiveConstructor{eq}, that argument must take one of two forms. Either it has the form \AgdaInductiveConstructor{im}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{a} (in which case the second explicit argument is \as{.(}\ab f \ab a \as )),\footnote{The dotted pattern is used when the form of the argument is forced... todo: fix this sentence} or it has the form \AgdaInductiveConstructor{eq} \ab b \ab a \ab p, where \ab p is a proof of \ab b \aof ≡ \ab f \ab a.  (The underscore characters replace \ab b and \ab p in the definition since \af{Inv} doesn't care about them; it only needs to extract and return the preimage \ab a.)

We can formally prove that \af{Inv} \ab f is the right-inverse of \ab f, as follows.  Again, we use pattern matching and structural induction.

As one would hope and expect, the \emph{left-}inverse of a monic function is derived from a proof \ab p~\as :~\af{Monic}~\ab f in a similar way. (See \af{MonicInv} and \af{MonicInvIsLeftInv} in \cite[\S2.3]{DeMeo:2021} for details.)

\subsection{Monic functions are set embeddings}\label{ssec:monics-are-set-embeddings}
This is the first point at which truncation (\S\ref{sssec:truncation-and-hsets}) comes into play.  An \defn{embedding}, as defined in the \TypeTopology library~\cite[\S26]{MHE}, is a function with \emph{subsingleton fibers}. The meaning of this will be clear from the definition, which involves the three functions \af{is-embedding}, \af{is-subsingleton}, and \af{fiber}. The second of these was defined above (\S\ref{sssec:truncation-and-hsets}); the other two are defined as follows.

This does not correspond simply to a monic function, and it is important to understand why not. Suppose \ab f~\as :~\ab X~\as →~\ab Y is a monic function from \ab X to \ab Y, so we have a proof \ab p \as : \af{Monic} \ab f.  To prove \ab f is an embedding we must show that for every \ab y~\as :~\ab Y we have
\AgdaFunction{is-subsingleton}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaSymbol{(}\AgdaFunction{fiber}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{f}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{y}\AgdaSymbol{)}.  That is, for all \ab y \as : \ab Y, we must prove the following implication:
%% show that if (\ab x \ac \ab p) and (\ab{x'} \ac \ab q) satisfy\\
\begin{equation*}
  \infer{(\ab x \Mac \ab p) \Maof ≡ (\ab{x'} \Mac \ab q)}
    {(\ab x \ \ab{x'} \Mas : \ab X) & (\ab p \Mas : \ab f \ \ab x \Maof ≡ \ab y) & (\ab q \Mas : \ab f\  \ab{x'} \Maof ≡ \ab y) & (\ab m \Mas : \af{Monic}\ \ab f)}
\end{equation*}
By \ab m, \ab p, and \ab q, we have \ab r \as : \ab x \aof ≡ \ab{x'}.
%% ; applying this to our initial antecedent gives (\af{ap} \ab q \ab r) \as : \ab f \ \ab x \aof ≡ \ab y.
%% \ab p \as : \ab f \ab x \aof ≡ \ab y and \ab q \as : \ab f \ab x \aof ≡ \ab y.
%% \\
%% \\
%% (\ab x \ab{x'} \as : \ab X) \hskip3mm (\ab a : \ab x \aof ≡ \ab{x'}) \hskip3mm (\ab p \as : \ab f \ab x \aof ≡ \ab y) \hskip3mm (\ab q \as : \ab f \ab x \aof ≡ \ab y)\\
%% \\
Thus, in order to prove \ab f~is an embedding, we must somehow show that the proofs \ab p and \ab q (each of which entails \ab f \ab x \aof ≡ \ab y) are the same.  However, there is no axiom or deduction rule in \mltt to indicate that \ab p \aof ≡ \ab q must hold; indeed, the two proofs may differ.

One way we could resolve this is to assume that the codomain type, \ab B, is a \emph{set}, i.e., has \emph{unique identity proofs}.
%% , then we can prove that a injective function into \ab B is an embedding.
Recall the definition~(\ref{code:is-set}) of \af{is-set} from the \typetopology library.
%% It is clear that this is precisely what we need.  That is, i
If the codomain of \ab f \as : \ab A → \ab B is a set, and if \ab p and \ab q are two proofs of an equality in \ab B, then \ab p \aof ≡ \ab q, and we can use this to prove that a injective function into \ab B is an embedding.

The type \AgdaFunction{Op} encodes the arity of an operation as an arbitrary type \ab I : \ab 𝓥 ̇, which gives us a very general way to represent an operation as a function type with domain \ab I → \ab A (the type of ``tuples'') and codomain \ab A. The last two lines of the code block above codify the \ab i-th \ab I-ary projection operation on \ab A.

\subsection{Signature type}\label{signature-type}
We define the signature of an algebraic structure in Agda like this.

Here \AgdaBound{𝓞} is the universe level of operation symbol types, while \AgdaBound{𝓥} is the universe level of arity types. Recall (\S\ref{ssec:dependent-pairs-and-projections}), we denote the first and second projections by \ai ∣ and \ai ∥, so if \ab 𝑆 is a signature, then \aiab{∣}{𝑆} denotes the type of \defn{operation symbols}, and \aiab{∥}{𝑆} denotes the \defn{arity} function. If \ab 𝑓 \as : \aiab{∣}{𝑆} is an operation symbol in the signature \ab 𝑆, then \aiab{∥}{𝑆} \ab 𝑓 is the arity of \ab 𝑓.

For example,

We may refer to an inhabitant of \af{Algebra} \ab 𝑆 \AgdaBound{𝓤} as an ``∞-algebra'' because its domain can be an arbitrary type, say, \ab A \as : \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ and need not be truncated at some level; in particular, \ab A need not be a \emph{set} (as defined in \S\ref{sssec:truncation-and-hsets}).

We could pause here to define the type of ``0-algebras,'' which are algebras whose domains are sets. This type is probably closer to what most of us think of when doing informal universal algebra. However, in the \ualib we have so far only needed to know that the domain of an algebra is a set in a handful of specific instances, so it seems preferable to work with general (∞-)algebras throughout the library and then assume \emph{uniquness of identity proofs} explicitly where, and only where, a proof relies on this assumption.

The type \ad{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 has type \ab 𝓞 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺ \af ̇, and the latter appears so often in the \ualib that we will refer to it by using the following shorthand for its level: \AgdaFunction{OV}\AgdaSpace{}\ab 𝓤 = \ab 𝓞 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺.\footnote{The \agdaualib includes an alternative definition of the type of algebras using records, but we don't discuss these here since they are not needed in the sequel. We refer the interested reader to~\cite{DeMeo:2021} and the html documentation available at \url{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Algebras.Algebras.html}.}

Finally, we will want to assume that we always have at our disposal an arbitrary collection \ab X of variable symbols such that, for every algebra \ab 𝑨, no matter the type of its domain, we have a surjective map \ab{h₀} \as : \ab X \as → \aiab{∣}{𝑨} from variables onto the domain of \ab 𝑨.

\subsection{The lift of an algebra}\label{ssec:the-lift-of-an-algebra}
%% This section describes parts of the \ualibLifts module of the \agdaualib.
%% BEGIN: \input{Lifts-short.tex}

The hierarchy of universe levels in Agda is structured as \ab{𝓤₀} \as : \ab{𝓤₁}, \hskip3mm \ab{𝓤₁} \as : \ab{𝓤₂}, \hskip3mm \ab{𝓤₂} \as : \ab{𝓤₃}, \ldots{}. This means that \ab{𝓤₀} has type \ab{𝓤₁} \AgdaFunction{̇} and \ab{𝓤ₙ} has type \ab{𝓤ₙ₊₁} \AgdaFunction{̇} for each \ab n.  It is important to note, however, this does \emph{not} imply that \ab{𝓤₀} \as : \ab{𝓤₂} and \ab{𝓤₀} \as : \ab{𝓤₃}, and so on. In other words, Agda's universe hierarchy is \emph{noncummulative}. This makes it possible to treat universe levels more generally and precisely, which is nice. On the other hand, it is this author's experience that a noncummulative hierarchy can sometimes make for a nonfun proof assistant.  (See~\cite[\S3.3.3]{DeMeo:2021} for a discussion.)

Luckily there are ways to circumvent noncummulativity without introducing logical inconsistencies into the type theory. We merely list here some domain specific tools that we developed for this purpose. (See~\cite[\S3.3.3]{DeMeo:2021} for more details).

A general \af{Lift} record type, similar to the one found in the \af{Level} module of the \agdastdlib, is
defined as follows.

\subsection{Unary Relations (predicates)}\label{sec:predicates}
\newcommand{\ovu}{\ab 𝓞 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺ \af ̇}
We need a mechanism for implementing the notion of subsets in Agda. A typical one is called \af{Pred} (for predicate). More generally, \af{Pred} \ab A \ab 𝓤 can be viewed as the type of a property that elements of type \ab{A} might satisfy. We write \ab P \as : \af{Pred} \ab A \ab 𝓤 to represent the semantic concept of a collection of elements of type \ab{A} that satisfy the property \ab{P}.
Here is the definition, which is similar to the one found in the \texttt{Relation/Unary.agda} file of the \agdastdlib.

Below we will often consider predicates over the class of all algebras of a particular type. We will define the type of algebras \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 (for some universe level \ab 𝓤). Like all types, \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 itself has a type which happens to be \ovu (see Section~\ref{ssec:algebra-type}). Therefore, the type of \af{Pred} (\af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆)\ab 𝓤 is \ovu as well.  By definition, the inhabitants of the type \af{Pred} (\af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆) \ab 𝓤 are maps of the form \ab 𝑨 \as → \ab 𝓤 \af ̇.

In type theory everything is a type. As we have just seen, this includes subsets. Since the notion of equality for types is usually a nontrivial matter, it may be nontrivial to represent equality of subsets. Fortunately, it is straightforward to write down a type that represents what it means for two subsets to be equal in informal (pencil-paper) mathematics. In the \ualib we denote this \defn{subset equality} by =̇ and define as follows.\footnote{Our notation and definition representing the semantic concept ``\ab x belongs to \ab P,'' or ``\ab x has property \ab P,'' is standard. We write either \ab x \af ∈ \ab P or \ab P \ab x. Similarly, the ``subset'' relation is denoted, as usual, with the \af{⊆} symbol (cf.  in the \agdastdlib).  The relations \af ∈ and \af{⊆} are defined in the \agdaualib in a was similar to that found in the \texttt{Relation/Unary.agda} module of the \agdastdlib. (See~\cite[\S4.1.2]{DeMeo:2021}.)}

\subsection{Binary Relations}\label{binary-relations}
%% This section highlights a few relevant parts of the \ualibBinary module of the \agdaualib.
%%-- BEGIN: \input{Relations/Binary.tex}----------
In set theory, a binary relation on a set \ab{A} is simply a subset of the product \ab A \af × \ab A. As such, we could model these as predicates over the type \ab A \af × \ab A, or as relations of type \ab A \as → \ab A \as → \ab 𝓡 \af ̇ (for some universe \ab 𝓡). A generalization of this notion is a binary relation is a \emph{relation from} \ab{A} \emph{to} \ab{B}, which we define first and treat binary relations on a single \ab{A} as a special case.

\subsection{Relation truncation}\label{ssec:relation-truncation}
Recall~\S\ref{sssec:truncation-and-hsets}, we described the concept of truncation as it relates to ``proof-relevant'' mathematics.  Given a binary relation \af P, it may be necessary or desirable to assume that there is at most one way to prove that a given pair of elements is \af P-related\footnote{This is another example of ``proof-irrelevance''; indeed, proofs of \af P \ab x \ab y are indistinguishable, or rather any distinctions are irrelevant in the context of interest.} We use the \af{is-subsingleton} type of the \typetopology library to express this strong assumption (of a \defn{0-truncated} type) in the following definition: We say that (\ab x \as , \ab y) belongs to \af P, or that \ab x and \ab y are \af P-related if and only if both \af P \ab x \ab y \emph{and} \af{is-subsingleton} (\af P \ab x \ab y) hold.

The zero relation \af{𝟎-rel} is equivalent to the identity relation \aod ≡ and, of course, these are both equivalence relations. Indeed, we saw in \S\ref{ssec:equality} that \aod ≡ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, so we simply apply the corresponding proofs where appropriate.

\section{Quotient Type}\label{sec:quotient-type}
Here we highlight some important parts of the \ualibQuotients module of the \agdaualib.
%% -- BEGIN: \input{Relations/Quotients.tex}

For a binary relation \ab R on \ab A, we denote a single \ab R-class by \af [ \ab a \af ] \ab R (this denotes the class containing \ab a). We denote the type of all classes of a relation \ab R on \ab A by \af 𝒞 \as{\{} \ab A \as{\}} \as{\{} \ab R \as{\}}.  These are defined as in the \ualib as follows.

\subsection{Quotient extensionality}\label{ssec:quotient-extensionality}
We need a (subsingleton) identity type for congruence classes over sets so that we can equate two classes even when they are presented using different representatives. For this we assume that our relations are on sets, rather than arbitrary types. As mentioned earlier, this is equivalent to assuming that there is at most one proof that two elements of a set are the same.

\subsection{Congruence relations}\label{ssec:congr-relat}
This \ualibCongruences module of the \agdaualib defines 
%% -- BEGIN: \input{Relations/Congruences.tex}
three alternative representations of congruence relations of an algebra---first as a function, then as a predicate on binary relations, and finally as a record type.
%% Notice that module begins by assuming a signature \ab 𝑆 \as : \af{Signature} \ab 𝓞 \ab 𝓥 which is then present and available throughout the module.

\subsubsection{Example}\label{Congruences.sssec:example}
In \S\ref{Equivalences.ssec:examples}, we defined the \emph{trivial} (or ``diagonal'' or ``identity'' or ``zero'') relation \af{𝟎-rel}  and observed that \af{𝟎-rel} is (equivalent to the identity relation \aod ≡ and) is an equivalence relations. Therefore, in order to build a congruence of some algebra \ab 𝑨 out of the trivial relation, it remains to show that \af{𝟎-rel} is compatible with all operations of \ab 𝑨.  We do this now and then construct the corresponding congruence.

\subsection{Quotient algebras}\label{ssec:quotient-algebras}
An important construction in universal algebra is the quotient of an algebra \ab 𝑨 with respect to a congruence relation \ab θ of \ab 𝑨. This quotient is typically denote by \ab 𝑨 \as / \ab θ and Agda allows us to define and express quotients using the standard notation.

\section{Equations and Varieties}\label{sec:equations-and-varieties}

\subsection{Types for Theories and Models}\label{ssec:types-for-theories-and-models}
The \ualibModelTheory module of  the \agdaualib defines types that represents \defn{identites} of terms in a given signature and what it means for a structure to satisfy, or \defn{model}, such identities.

Let \ab 𝑆 be a signature. By an \defn{identity} or \defn{equation} in \ab 𝑆 we mean an ordered pair of terms, written \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞, from the term algebra \af 𝑻 \ab X. If \ab 𝑨 is an \ab 𝑆-algebra we say that \ab 𝑨 \defn{satisfies} \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞 provided \ab 𝑝 \af ̇ \ab 𝑨 \aod ≡ \ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 holds. In this situation, we write \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞 and say that \ab 𝑨 \defn{models} the identity \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab q. If \ab 𝒦 is a class of algebras, all of the same signature, we write \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≈ \ab q if, for every \ab 𝑨 \aof ∈ \ab 𝒦, \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞.

\noindent \textbf{Notation}. In the \agdaualib, because a class of structures has a different type than a single structure, we must use a slightly different syntax to avoid overloading the relations \af ⊧ and \af ≈. As a reasonable alternative to what we would normally express informally as 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞, we have settled on \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≋ \ab q to denote this relation.  To reiterate, if \ab 𝒦 is a class of \ab 𝑆-algebras, we write \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≋ \ab 𝑞 if every \ab 𝑨 \aof ∈ \ab 𝒦 satisfies \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞.


\subsubsection{The models relation}\label{the-models-relation}

%% --BEGIN: \input{Varieties/ModelTheory.tex}
The \ualibModelTheory module of the \agdaualib defines the binary ``models'' relation \aof ⊧ relating algebras (or classes of algebras) to the identities that they satisfy.  Agda supports the definition of infix operations and relations, and we use this to define \aof ⊧ so that we may write, e.g., \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≈ \ab q or \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≋ \ab q.

After \aof ⊧ is defined, a couple of useful facts about \aof ⊧ are proved. (More is proved about the models relation in \S\ref{sec:equational-logic-types}.)

\subsubsection{Computing with ⊧}\label{sssec:computing-with}
We have formally defined \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞, which represents the assertion that \ab p \aof ≈ \ab q holds when this identity is interpreted in the algebra \ab 𝑨; syntactically, \ab 𝑝 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 \aof ≡ \ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨.  It should be emphasized that the expression \ab 𝑝 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 \aof ≡ \ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 is interpreted computationally as an \emph{extensional equality}, by which we mean that for each \emph{assignment function} \ab 𝒂 \as : \ab X \as → \aiab{∣}{𝑨}, assigning values in the domain of \ab 𝑨 to the variable symbols in \ab X, we have (\ab 𝑝 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨) \ab 𝒂 \aof ≡ (\ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨) \ab 𝒂.

The binary relation \aof ⊧ would be practically useless if it were not an \emph{algebraic invariant} (invariant under isomorphism), and this fact is proved below (by showing that a certain term operation identity, \AgdaBound{p}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{̇}}\AgdaSpace{}%
