\begin{abstract}
The Agda Universal Algebra Library (UALib) is a library of types and programs (theorems and proofs) we developed to formalize the foundations of universal algebra in dependent type theory using the Agda programming language and proof assistant. 
 The UALib includes a substantial collection of definitions, theorems, and proofs from universal algebra, equational logic, and model theory, and as such provides many examples that exhibit the power of inductive and dependent types for representing and reasoning about mathematical structures and equational theories. In this paper we describe some of the most important foundational types and assumptions of the UALib, and we discuss some of the problems that arose when developing it, as well as our solutions to these problems.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
To support formalization in type theory of research level mathematics in universal algebra and related fields, we present the Agda Universal Algebra Library (\agdaualib), a software library containing formal statements and proofs of the core definitions and results of universal algebra. 
The \ualib is written in \agda~\cite{Norell:2009}, a programming language and proof assistant based on Martin-L\"of Type Theory that not only supports dependent and inductive types, as well as proof tactics for proving things about the objects that inhabit these types.

There have been a number of efforts to formalize parts of universal algebra in type theory prior to ours, most notably
\begin{itemize}
  \item Capretta~\cite{Capretta:1999} (1999) formalized the basics of universal algebra in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions using the Coq proof assistant;
    \item Spitters and van der Weegen~\cite{Spitters:2011} (2011) formalized the basics of universal algebra and some classical algebraic structures, also in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions using the Coq proof assistant, promoting the use of type classes as a preferable alternative to setoids;
 \item Gunther, et al~\cite{Gunther:2018} (2018) developed what seems to be (prior to the \ualib) the most extensive library of formal universal algebra to date; in particular, this work includes a formalization of some basic equational logic; the project (like the \ualib) uses Martin-L\"of Type Theory and the Agda proof assistant.
\end{itemize}
Some other projects aimed at formalizing mathematics generally, and algebra in particular, have developed into very extensive libraries that include definitions, theorems, and proofs about algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, modules, etc.  However, the goals of these efforts seem to be the formalization of special classical algebraic structures, as opposed to the general theory of (universal) algebras. Moreover, the part of universal algebra and equational logic formalized in the \ualib extends beyond the scope of prior efforts and. In particular, the library now includes a proof of Birkhoff's variety theorem.  Most other proofs of this theorem that we know of are informal and nonconstructive.\footnote{After the completion of this work, the author learned about a constructive version of Birkhoff's theorem that was proved by Carlstr\"om in~\cite{Carlstrom:2008}.  The latter is presented in the standard, informal style of mathematical writing in the current literature, and as far as we know it was never implemented formally and type-checked with a proof assistant. Nonetheless, a comparison of the version of the theorem presented in~\cite{Carlstrom:2008} to the Agda proof we give here would be interesting.}
 %% We remark briefly on this in~\S\ref{sec:conclusions-and-future-work}.}

%% \subsection{Vision and Goals}\label{vision-and-goals}
The seminal idea for the \agdaualib project was the observation that, on the one hand, a number of fundamental constructions in universal algebra can be defined recursively, and theorems about them proved by structural induction, while, on the other hand, inductive and dependent types make possible very precise formal representations of recursively defined objects, which often admit elegant constructive proofs of properties of such objects.  An important feature of such proofs in type theory is that they are total functional programs and, as such, they are computable, composable, and machine-verifiable.
%% These observations suggested that there would be much to gain from implementing universal algebra in a language, such as Martin-L\"of type theory, that features dependent and inductive types.

Finally, our own research experience has taught us that a proof assistant and programming language (like Agda), when equipped with specialized libraries and domain-specific tactics to automate proof idioms of a particular field, can be an extremely powerful and effective asset. We believe that such libraries, and the proof assistants they support, will eventually become indispensable tools in the working mathematician's toolkit.



\subsection{Contributions and organization}
\label{sec:contributions}

In this paper we limit ourselves to the presentation of the core foundational modules of the \ualib so that we have space to discuss some of the more interesting type theoretic and foundational issues that arose when developing the library and attempting to represent advanced mathematical notions in type theory and formalize them in Agda.
We are preparing two follow-up papers covering more advanced aspects of the library. The planned contents of these are mentioned in the conclusion of the paper.

This paper is structured as follows.
%
Section~\ref{sec:agda-preliminaries} introduces Sigma types in Agda (for us, the most important dependent type in the language) as well as Agda's universe hierarchy and problems solved by ``lifting'' techniques.
%
Section~\ref{sec:relations} introduces the \agdaualib by explaining how predicates, binary relations, and function kernels are represented in the library. 
%
Section~\ref{ssec:relation-truncation} discusses the important topic of \emph{truncated types} and how truncation is employed in the \ualib.
%
Section~\ref{quotient-types} defines quotient types and introduces the concept of \emph{quotient extensionality}, which is necessary for determining when two quotient classes are equal.
%
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:types-for-algebras} describes the type we use to represent algebraic structures, product algebras, including arbitrary products of entire classes of algebraic structures.  We also define congruence relations and quotient algebras in this section.
%
%
The final section of the paper includes a few remarks about current work and future directions.

To conclude this introduction, we provide the following links to official sources of information about the \agdaualib.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io}{\texttt{ualib.org}} (the web site) includes every line of code in the library, rendered as html and accompanied by documentation, and
  \item \href{https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io}{\texttt{gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io}} (the source code) freely available and licensed under the \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/}{Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License}.
\end{itemize}
These sources include complete proofs of every theorem we mention here, and much more. Finally, we highly recommend the book by Bergman~\cite{Bergman:2012} for background in universal algebra, and the notes by \escardo~\cite{MHE} for background in type theory and Agda.

\section{Agda Preliminaries}\label{sec:agda-preliminaries}


For the benefit of readers who are not proficient in Agda or type theory, we briefly describe some of the most important types and features used in the \ualib.  Of necessity, the descriptions will be terse, but are usually accompanied by pointers to relevant sections of the appendix or the \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io}{html documentation}.

We begin by highlighting some of the key parts of the \ualibPreliminaries module of the \ualib. This module imports everything we need from Martin Escard\'o's \typetopology library~\cite{MHE}, defines some basic types and proves some of their properties.  We do not cover the entire Preliminaries module here, but instead call attention to aspects that differ from standard Agda syntax. For more details, see~\cite[\S2]{DeMeo:2021}.

Agda programs typically begin by setting some options and by importing from existing libraries.
Options are specified with the \AgdaKeyword{OPTIONS} \emph{pragma} and control the way Agda behaves by, for example, specifying which logical foundations should be assumed when the program is type-checked to verify its correctness. 
Every Agda program in the \ualib begins with the following pragma, which has the effects described below.
\ccpad

\AgdaPragma{--exact-split}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaPragma{--safe}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaSymbol{\#-\}}\<%
\end{code}
\\[-20pt]
%% \begin{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item \AgdaPragma{without-K} disables \axiomk; see~\cite{agdaref-axiomk};
\item \AgdaPragma{exact-split} makes Agda accept only definitions that are \emph{judgmental} or \emph{definitional} equalities; see~\cite{agdatools-patternmatching};
\item \AgdaPragma{safe} ensures that nothing is postulated outright---every non-MLTT axiom has to be an explicit assumption (e.g., an argument to a function or module); see~\cite{agdaref-safeagda} and~\cite{agdatools-patternmatching}.
\end{itemize}
%% \end{enumerate}
Throughout this paper we take assumptions 1--3 for granted without mentioning them explicitly.







\subsection{Agda's universe hierarchy}\label{ssec:agdas-universe-hierarchy}
The \agdaualib adopts the notation of Martin Escardo's \typetopology library~\cite{MHE}. In particular, \emph{universe levels}%
\footnote{See \url{https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1.2/language/universe-levels.html}.}
are denoted by capitalized script letters from the second half of the alphabet, e.g., \ab 𝓤, \ab 𝓥, \ab 𝓦, etc.  Also defined in \typetopology are the operators~\af ̇~and~\af ⁺. These map a universe level \ab 𝓤 to the universe \ab 𝓤\af ̇ := \Set \ab 𝓤 and the level \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺ \aod := \lsuc \ab 𝓤, respectively.  Thus, \ab 𝓤\af ̇ is simply an alias for the universe \Set \ab 𝓤, and we have \ab 𝓤\af ̇ \as : (\ab 𝓤 \af ⁺)\af ̇.
%% Table~\ref{tab:dictionary} translates between standard \agda syntax and \typetopology/\ualib notation.

The hierarchy of universes in Agda is structured as \ab{𝓤}\af ̇ \as : \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺\af ̇, \hskip3mm
\ab{𝓤} \af ⁺\af ̇ \as : \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺\af ⁺\af ̇, etc. This means that the universe \ab 𝓤\af ̇ has type \ab 𝓤  \af ⁺\af ̇, and 𝓤 \af ⁺\af ̇ has type \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺\af ⁺\af ̇, and so on.  It is important to note, however, this does \emph{not} imply that \ab 𝓤\af ̇ \as : \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺\af ⁺\af ̇. In other words, Agda's universe hierarchy is \emph{noncummulative}. This makes it possible to treat universe levels more generally and precisely, which is nice. On the other hand, a noncummulative hierarchy can sometimes make for a nonfun proof assistant. Luckily, there are ways to circumvent noncummulativity without introducing logical inconsistencies into the type theory. Section~\ref{lifting-algebra-types} describes some domain specific tools that we developed for this purpose.








\subsection{Dependent pairs}\label{ssec:dependent-pairs}
Given universes \ab 𝓤 and \ab 𝓥, a type \ab X \as : \ab 𝓤 \aof ̇, and a type family \ab Y \as : X \as → \ab 𝓥 \aof ̇, the \defn{Sigma type} (or \defn{dependent pair type}), denoted by \AgdaRecord{Σ}(\ab x \as ꞉ \ab X)\as ,\ab Y \ab x, generalizes the Cartesian product \ab X~\as ×~\ab Y by allowing the type \ab Y \ab x of the second argument of the ordered pair (\ab x\as , \ab y) to depend on the value \ab x of the first.  That is, \AgdaRecord{Σ}(\ab x \as ꞉ \ab X)\as ,\ab Y \ab x is inhabited by the pairs (\ab x\as , \ab y) such that \ab x \as : \ab X and \ab y \as : \ab Y \ab x.

Agda's default syntax for a Sigma type is \AgdaRecord{Σ}\sP{3}\AgdaSymbol{λ}(\ab x\sP{3}꞉\sP{3}\ab X)\sP{3}\as →\sP{3}\ab Y, but we prefer the notation \AgdaRecord{Σ}~\ab x~꞉~\ab X~,~\ab Y, which is closer to the standard syntax described in the preceding paragraph. Fortunately, this preferred notation is available in the \typetopology library (see~\cite[Σ types]{MHE}).\footnote{The symbol \as ꞉ in the expression \AgdaRecord{Σ}\sP{3}\ab x\sP{3}\as ꞉\sP{3}\ab X\sP{3}\AgdaComma\sP{3}\ab Y is not the ordinary colon; rather, it is the symbol obtained by typing \texttt{\textbackslash{}:4} in \agdatwomode.} 

\newcommand\FstUnder{\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{∣\AgdaUnderscore{}∣}}\xspace}
\newcommand\SndUnder{\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{∥\AgdaUnderscore{}∥}}\xspace}
Convenient notations for the first and second projections out of a product are \FstUnder and \SndUnder, respectively. However, to improve readability or to avoid notation clashes with other modules, we sometimes use more standard alternatives, such as \AgdaFunction{pr₁} and \AgdaFunction{pr₂}, or \AgdaFunction{fst} and \AgdaFunction{snd}, or some combination of these. The definitions are standard so we omit them (see~\cite{DeMeo:2021} for details).







\subsection{Equality and function extensionality}\label{sec:equal-funct-extens}
Perhaps the most important types in type theory are the equality types. The \emph{definitional equality} we use is a standard one and is often referred to as ``reflexivity'' or ``refl''.  In our case, it is defined in the Identity-Type module of the \TypeTopology library, but apart from syntax it is equivalent to the identity type used in most other Agda libraries. Here is the definition.

%% \subsubsection{Function extensionality and intensionality}\label{sssec:function-extensionality-and-intensionality}
Extensional equality of functions, or \emph{function extensionality}, is a principle that is often assumed in the \agdaualib. It asserts that two point-wise equal functions are equal and is defined in the \typetopology library in the following natural way. First, given a type family \AgdaBound{A}~\AgdaSymbol{:}~\AgdaBound{X}~\AgdaSymbol{→}~\AgdaGeneralizable{𝓥}\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{̇}}, the point-wise equality of two inhabitants \ab f and \ab g of the (dependent) function type \AgdaFunction{Π}~\AgdaBound{A} is denoted by \AgdaBound{f}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{∼}}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{g}\AgdaSpace{}and defined as follows.

Point-wise equality of functions is typically what one means in informal settings when one says that two functions are equal. However, as \escardo notes in~\cite{MHE}, function extensionality is known to be neither provable nor disprovable in Martin-Löf Type Theory. It is an independent axiom which may be assumed (or not) without making the logic inconsistent.

The next function defines the converse of function extensionality.

Although the proof of the \af{extdfun} lemma is trivial, it can clarify an otherwise confusing argument to invoke this lemma explicitly (e.g., when given a definitional equality where a point-wise equality is required).

An important conceptual distinction exists between type definitions similar in form to \af{funext} and those similar to \af{extdfun}.  Notice that the codomain of the former is a generic type, namely,
\AgdaSymbol{(}\AgdaBound{𝓤}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaPrimitive{⊔}}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{𝓥}\AgdaSymbol{)}\AgdaOperator{\AgdaPrimitive{⁺}}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{̇}}, while the codomain of the latter is the assertion
\AgdaBound{f}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{∼}}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{g}.  Also, the defining equation of \af{dfunext} is an assertion, while the defining equation of \af{extdfun} is a proof.  As such, \af{extdfun} is a proof object; it proves (inhabits the type that represents) the proposition asserting that definitionally equivalent functions are point-wise equal. In contrast, \af{funext} is a type that we may or may not wish to \emph{assume}.  That is, we may assume we have a witness, say, \ab{fe} \as : \af{funext} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝓥, that is, a proof that point-wise equal functions are equivalent, but, as noted above, the existence of such a witness cannot be proved in Martin-L\"of type theory.

Finally, an assumption that we adopt throughout most of the current version of the \ualib is a \defn{global function extensionality principle}. This asserts that function extensionality holds no matter the types of the domains and codomains of the given functions.\footnote{Of course, the domains (resp., codomains) of the given functions must be the same!} This type is defined in the \typetopology library as follows.
\ccpad

\AgdaFunction{dfunext}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{𝓤}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{𝓥}\<%
\end{code}
\ccpad
This principle is stronger than necessary and we could get away with assuming only (local) function extensionality at carefully selected types. However, assuming global function extensionality substantially simplifies the types and their presentation.

%% Besides \af{dfunext} and \af{global-dfunext}, other dependent and polymorphic notions of extensionality are represented as types and defined in the \ualib and \typetopology libraries, but we omit the (see~\cite[\S2.4]{DeMeo:2021} and~\cite[\S17-18]{MHE}).

%% Relations %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Relation and Quotient Types}\label{sec:relations}

This section presents some of the most important relation and quotient types that are defined in the \ualibRelations module of the \agdaualib.\footnote{For more details see \urlRelations.}

In \S\ref{discrete-relations} we cover \emph{unary} and \emph{binary relations}, which we refer to as ``discrete'' to contrast them with the (``continuous'') \emph{general} and \emph{dependent relations} that we take up in \S\ref{continuous-relations}. We call the latter ``continuous relations'' because they can have arbitrary arity (general relations) and they can be defined over arbitrary families of types (dependent relations).


\subsection{Discrete Relations}\label{discrete-relations}

We need a mechanism for implementing the notion of subsets in Agda. A typical one is called \af{Pred} (for predicate). More generally, \af{Pred} \ab A \ab 𝓤 can be viewed as the type of a property that elements of type \ab A might satisfy. We write \ab P \as : \af{Pred} \ab A \ab 𝓤 to represent the semantic concept of a collection of elements of type \ab A that satisfy the property \ab P. Here is the definition (which is similar to the one found in the \texttt{Relation/Unary.agda} file of the \agdastdlib.
\ccpad

\AgdaBound{A}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaSymbol{→}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{𝓦}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{̇}}\<%
\end{code}
\ccpad
If we are given a type \ab A \as : \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ , then we think of \af{Pred} \ab A \ab 𝓦 as the type of a property that inhabitants of \ab A may or may not satisfy. If \ab P \as : \af{Pred} \ab A \ab 𝓦, then we can view \ab P as a collection of inhabitants of type \ab A that ``satisfy property \ab P,'' or that ``belong to the subset \ab P of \ab A.''

Below we will often consider predicates over the class of all algebras of a particular type. Soon we will define the type \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 of algebras (for some universe level \ab 𝓤),
%% Like all types, \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 itself has a type which (as we will soon see) happens to be \ab 𝓞 \as ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \as ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺
%% ̇ . %the module \href{UALib.Algebras.Algebras.html}{UALib.Algebras}).
and the type \af{Pred} (\af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆) \ab 𝓤  %will be \ab 𝓞 \as ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \as ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺ ̇ as well.
will be inhabited by maps of the form \ab 𝑨 \as → \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ ; more precisely, given an algebra \ab 𝑨 \as : \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆, we will consider the type \af{Pred} \ab 𝑨 \ab 𝓤 \as = \ab 𝑨 \as → \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ . We will use predicates over algebra types to specify subclasses of algebras with certain properties.






% \subsection{Membership and inclusion relations}\label{membership-and-inclusion-relations}

Of course, the \ualib includes types that represent element-wise inclusion and subset containment. For example, given a predicate \af P, we may represent that  ``\ab x belongs to \af P'' or that ``\ab x has property \af{P},'' by writing either \ab x \af ∈ \af P or \af P \ab x.  The definition of \af ∈ is standard (cf.~\texttt{Relation/Unary.agda} in the \agdastdlib). Nonetheless, here it is.

The notion of equality of types is a nontrivial matter, and therefore so is the matter of equating subsets that are defined using predicate types.  Fortunately, it is straightforward to write down a type that represents what it means for two subsets to be the same in informal mathematics. In the \ualib we denote this \textit{subset equality} by \af{\(\doteq\)} and define it as follows.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
\>[0]\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{\AgdaUnderscore{}\(\doteq\)\AgdaUnderscore{}}}\AgdaSpace{}%

Thus, a proof of \AgdaBound{P}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{\(\doteq\)}}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{Q}\AgdaSpace{}%
is a pair (\ab p , \ab q) where \ab p \as : \AgdaBound{P}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{⊆}}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{Q} is a proof of the first inclusion and \ab q is a proof of \AgdaBound{Q}\AgdaSpace{}%

In set theory, a binary relation on a set \ab{A} is simply a subset of the Cartesian product \ab A × \ab A. As such, we could model these as predicates over the product type \ab A \af × \ab A, or as relations of type
\ab A \as → \ab A \as → \ab 𝓡 \af ̇  (for some universe \ab 𝓡). We define these below.

A generalization of the notion of binary relation is a \emph{relation from} \ab{A} \emph{to} \ab{B}, which we define first and treat binary relations on a single \ab{A} as a special case.

The \defn{kernel} of a function \ab f \as : \ab A \AgdaSymbol{→} \ab B is defined informally as the set \{(\ab x , \ab y) ∈ \ab A × \ab A : \ab f \ab x = \ab f \ab y\}. This can be represented in type theory and Agda in a number of ways, each of which may be useful in a particular context. For example, we could define the kernel as a Sigma type (omitted),

\subsection{Compatibility of binary relations}\label{compatibility-of-binary-relations}

Before discussing general and dependent relations, we pause to define some types that are useful for asserting and proving facts about \emph{compatibility} of functions with binary relations. The first definition simply lifts a binary relation on \ab A to a binary relation on tuples of type \ab I \as → \ab A.\footnote{N.B. This \emph{relation} lifting is not to be confused with the sort of \emph{universe} lifting that we defined in the \ualibLifts module.}

However, this is a rare case in which the more elegant syntax may result in simpler proofs when applying the definition. (See, for example, \af{compatible-term} in the \ualibOperations module.)

\subsection{Continuous Relations}\label{continuous-relations}
This section describes certain key components of the \ualibContinuous module.\footnote{For more details, see \urlContinuous.}


In set theory, an \ab n-ary relation on a set \ab{A} is simply a subset of the \ab n-fold product \ab{A} \ad × \ab A \ad × \as ⋯ \ad × \ab A. As such, we could model these as predicates over the type \ab{A} \ad × \as ⋯ \ad × \ab A, or as relations of type \ab{A} \as → \ab A \as → \as ⋯ \as → \ab A \as → \ab 𝓦 \af ̇~(for some universe \ab 𝓦). To implement such a relation in type theory, we would need to know the arity in advance, and then somehow form an \ab n-fold arrow \as →.

A more general and straightforward approach is to instead define an arity type \ab{I} \as : \ab 𝓥 \af ̇ , and define the type representing \ab{I}-ary relations on \ab{A} as the function type (\ab{I} \as → \ab A) \as → \ab 𝓦 \af ̇. Then, if we are specifically interested in an \ab n-ary relation for some natural number \ab{n}, we could take \ab{I} to be a finite set (e.g., of type \af{Fin} n).

Below we will define \af{GenRel} to be the type (\ab{I} \as → \ab A) \as → \ab 𝓦 \af ̇ and we will call \af{GenRel} the type of \defn{general relations}. This generalizes the unary and binary relations we saw earlier in the sense that general relations can have arbitrarily large arities. However, relations of type \af{GenRel} are still not completely general because they are defined over a single type. Just as \af{Rel} \ab A \ab 𝓦 was the ``single-sorted'' special case of the ``multisorted'' binary relation type \ab{REL} \ab A \ab B \ab 𝓦, so too will \ab{GenRel} \ab I \ab A \ab 𝓦 be the single-sorted version of a completely general type of relations. The latter will represent relations that not only have arbitrary arities, but also are defined over arbitrary families of types.

To be more concrete, given an arbitrary family \ab{A} \as : \ab I \as → \ab 𝓤 \af ̇ of types, we may have a relation from \ab{A} \ab i to \ab{A} \ab i' to \ab{A} \ab i'' to $\ldots$. We will refer to such relations as \defn{dependent relations} because in order to define a type to represent them, we absolutely need depedent types. The \af{DepRel} type that we define below is the manifestation of a completely general notion of relation.

\subsubsection{General relations}\label{general-relations}

We now define the type \ab{GenRel} that represents predicates (or relations) of arbitrary arity over a single type \ab{A}. We call this the type of \textbf{general relations}.\footnote{%
\textbf{Notation}. For consistency and readability, throughout the \ualib we treat two universe variables with special care. The first of these is 𝓞 which shall be reserved for types that represent
\emph{operation symbols} (see \ualibSignatures). The second is 𝓥 which we reserve for types representing \emph{arities} of relations or operations.}

In the definition of \af{gen-compatible-fun}, we let Agda infer the type of \ab{𝕒}, which is \ab{I} \as → (\ab J \as → \ab A).

\begin{comment}
If the syntax of the last two definitions makes you feel a bit nauseated, we recommend focusing on the semantics instead of the semantics. In fact, we should probably pause here to discuss these semantics, lest the more complicated definitions below induce the typical consequence of nausea.

First, internalize the fact that \ab{𝕒\ :\ I\ →\ (J\ →\ A)} denotes
an \ab{I}-tuple of \ab{J}-tuples of inhabitants of \ab{A}.
Once that's obvious, recall that a general relation \ab{R}
represents a certain collection of \ab{I}-tuples. Specifically, if
\ab{x\ :\ I\ →\ A} is an \ab{I}-tuple, then \ab{R\ x}
denotes the assertion that ``\ab{x} belongs to \ab{R}'' or
``\ab{x} satisfies \ab{R}.''

Next consider the function \ab{lift-gen-rel}. For each general
relation \ab{R}, the type \ab{lift-gen-rel\ R} represents a
certain collection of \ab{I}-tuples of \ab{J}-tuples, namely,
the \ab{𝕒\ :\ I\ →\ (J\ →\ A)} such that \ab{lift-gen-rel\ R\ 𝕒}
holds.

It helps to visualize such \ab{J}-tuples as columns and imagine for
simplicity that \ab{J} is a finite set, say,
\ab{\{1,\ 2,\ ...,\ J\}}. Picture a couple of these columns, say,
the i-th and k-th, like so.

\begin{verbatim}
𝕒 i 1      𝕒 k 1
𝕒 i 2      𝕒 k 2
𝕒 i 3      𝕒 k 3    <-- (a row of I such columns forms an I-tuple)
  ⋮          ⋮
𝕒 i J      𝕒 k J
\end{verbatim}

Now \ab{lift-gen-rel\ R\ 𝕒} is defined by
\ab{∀\ j\ →\ R\ (λ\ i\ →\ (𝕒\ i)\ j)} which represents the assertion
that each row of the \ab{I} columns shown above (which evidently is
an \ab{I}-tuple) belongs to the original relation \ab{R}.

Next, let's dissect the definition of \ab{gen-compatible-fun}. Here,
\ab{𝕗\ :\ I\ →\ (J\ →\ A)\ →\ A} denotes an \ab{I}-tuple of
\ab{J}-ary operations on \ab{A}. That is, for each
\ab{i\ :\ I}, the function \ab{𝕗\ i} takes a \ab{J}-tuple
\ab{𝕒\ i\ :\ J\ →\ A} and evaluates to some
\ab{(𝕗\ i)\ (𝕒\ i)\ :\ A}.

Finally, digest all the types involved in these definitions and note how
nicely they align (as they must if type-checking is to succeed!). For
example, \ab{𝕒\ :\ I\ →\ (J\ →\ A)} is precisely the type on which
the relation \ab{lift-gen-rel\ R} is defined.

\subsubsection{Dependent relations}\label{dependent-relations}

In this section we exploit the power of dependent types to define a completely general relation type. Specifically, we let the tuples inhabit a dependent function type, where the codomain may depend upon the input coordinate \ab i \as : \ab I of the domain. Heuristically, think of the inhabitants of the following type as relations from \ab{A} \ab{i₁} to \ab{A} \ab{i₂} to \ab{A} \ab{i₃} to $\ldots$. (This is just for intuition since the domain \ab{I} need not be enumerable.)

Above we saw lifts of general relations and what it means for such relations to be compatible with functions. We conclude this module by defining the (only slightly more complicated) lift of dependent relations, and the type that represents compatibility of a tuple of operations with a dependent relation.

\section{Truncation}\label{ssec:relation-truncation}

In this section we discuss \emph{truncation} and \emph{sets} (or \emph{h-sets}). We first give a brief discussion of standard notions of trunction~(\S\ref{sec:standard-type-truncation}), and then we describe an alternative viewpoint that we have found useful for formalizing universal algebra in Agda~(\S\ref{binary-relation-truncation}). (Readers wishing to know more about standard notions of truncation and proof-relevant mathematics may consult~\cite[\S34-35]{MHE} or~\cite[\S7.1]{HoTT:2013}, for example.)

\subsection{A typical view of truncation}\label{sec:standard-type-truncation}
In general, we may have many inhabitants of a given type, hence (via Curry-Howard) many proofs of a given proposition. For instance, suppose we have a type \ab X and an identity relation \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} on \ab X so that, given two inhabitants of \ab X, say, \ab a\AgdaSpace{}\ab b \as : \ab X, we can form the type \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b. Suppose \ab p and \ab q inhabit the type \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b; that is, \ab p and \ab q are proofs of \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b, in which case we write \ab p \ab q : \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b. Then we might wonder whether and in what sense are the two proofs \ab p and \ab q the ``same.'' We are asking about an identity type on the identity type \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}}, and whether there is some inhabitant \ab r of this type; i.e., whether there is a proof \ab r : \ab p \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ₁}} \ab q.  If such a proof exists for all \ab p \ab q : \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b, then we say that the proof of \ab a \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}} \ab b is \emph{unique}. As a property of the types \ab X and \aod{≡ₓ}, this is sometimes called \emph{uniqueness of identity proofs}.

Perhaps we have two proofs, say, \ab r \ab s : \ab p \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ₁}} \ab q. Then it is natural to wonder whether \ab r~\AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ₂}}~\ab s has a proof.  At some level, though, the potential to distinguish two proofs of an identity in a meaningful way (so-called \emph{proof relevance}) may be uninteresting or useless. At that point, say, at level \ab k, we would naturally assume that there is at most one proof of any identity of the form \ab p  \AgdaOperator{\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓₖ}} \ab q. This is called \emph{truncation}.

In \emph{homotopy type theory}~\cite{HoTT:2013}, a type \ab X with an identity relation \AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ} is called a \defn{set} (or \defn{0-groupoid} or \defn{h-set}) if for every pair \ab a \ab b \as : \ab X of elements of type \ab X there is at most one proof of \ab a~\AgdaDatatype{≡ₓ}~\ab b.

%% Briefly, we say that a type \ab X is a \textit{set} if it has the following property: for all \ab x \ab y \as : \ab X there is at most one proof of \ab x \af ≡ \ab y. In other terms, using the \af{is-subsingleton} function from Martin Escard\'o's \typetopology library, \ab{X} is a set if and only if it satisfies

%% \as ∀ \ab x \ab y \as : \ab X  \as → \af{is-subsingleton}(\ab x \as ≡ \ab y).

This notion is formalized in Escard\'o's \TypeTopology library by the types \af{is-set} and \af{is-subsingleton}, which are defined as follows.

In the \agdaualib, we take a different approach to truncation which turns out to be useful for our domain of application.  Rather than think of truncation as a property of types, we consider it to be a property of relations on types.  In the definitions of \af{is-set} and \af{is-subsingleton} above, it is the type \ab X that is viewed as a truncated type.  However, it seems more natural to describe this as a feature of the binary equality relation \AgdaDatatype{≡} with which the type \ab X is endowed.

Taking this view in the next section, we discuss and formalize notions of relation truncation that are used in just a few key places in the \ualib, where and only where they are needed (for example, in the proofs of Emmy Noether's first isomorphism theorem and Garrett Birkhoff's variety theorem).

\subsection{Atypical view of truncation}\label{binary-relation-truncation}
In the \agdaualib, we apply the truncation concept to general relation types rather than to the equality relation on types.  For example, we say that a predicate \af P is a \emph{truncated unary relation} if there is at most one proof that an element satisfies (belongs to) \af P.  Similarly, we call \af P a \emph{truncated binary relation} if there is at most one proof that a pair of elements belongs to \af P or is \af P-related.\footnote{The distinction between the ``typical'' and ``atypical'' notions of truncation is a mere change in viewpoint; in fact, we didn't immediately notice the distinction and then even hesitated to point it out.  Moreover, the focus on relations rather than types is so natural that it is almost certain to have been proposed elsewhere. Nonetheless, we present it here because of the role it plays in our formalization effort.}

In the \ualib we define types that manifest these notions of proof-irrelevance. Here is the \emph{truncated unary relation} type.

If \af P is a binary relation and if \ab p \ab q \as : \af P \ab x \ab y are two proofs that the pair (\ab x , \ab y) belongs to \af P, then proof-irrelevance would take \ab p and \ab q to be indistinguishable. We define such a \emph{truncated binary relation} type (again using Escard\'o's \af{is-subsingleton} function), and we say that (\ab x , \ab y) belongs to \af P, or \ab x and \ab y are \af P-related if and only if both \af P \ab x \ab y \textit{and} \af{is-subsingleton} (\af P \ab x \ab y) hold.

\subsection{Properties of binary relations}\label{properties-of-binary-relations}

Let \ab{𝓤} \as : \af{Universe} and \ab A \as : \ab 𝓤\af ̇.
Above we defined types representing binary relations on the type \ab A.
The \ualib also has types representing properties of binary relations and types for relations that have such properties. The most important properties of relations are the familiar ones represented by the following types: \AgdaFunction{reflexive}, \AgdaFunction{symmetric}, \AgdaFunction{antisymmetric}, \AgdaFunction{transitive}.  Since the definitions of these are exactly as one would hope and expect, we omit them (see \ualibDiscrete for details).
%% all but one of them.

%% \subsection{Equivalence classes}\label{equivalence-classes-1}
If \ab R is an equivalence relation on \ab A, then for each \ab 𝑎 \as : \ab A there is an \defn{equivalence class} containing \ab 𝑎, which we denote and define by \af [ \ab 𝑎 \af ] \ab R := \{ \ab 𝑏~\as :~\ab A ∣ \ab R \ab 𝑎 \ab 𝑏\}. We often refer to \af [ \ab 𝑎 \af ] \ab R as the \ab R-\emph{class containing} \ab 𝑎. Here is the formal definition one finds in the \ualib.

If \ab{R} is an equivalence relation on \ab{A}, then the \textit{quotient} of \ab{A} modulo \ab{R} is denoted by
\ab{A} \af / \ab R and is defined to be the collection \{ \af [ \ab 𝑎 \af ] \ab R ∣  \ab 𝑎 \as : \ab A \} of all equivalence classes of \ab{R}. There are a few ways we could define the quotient with respect to a relation, but we find the following to be the most useful.

\subsection{Quotient extensionality}\label{quotient-extensionality}

We need a (subsingleton) identity type for congruence classes over sets so that we can equate two classes even when they are presented using different representatives. For this we assume that our relations are on sets, rather than arbitrary types. As mentioned earlier, this is equivalent to assuming that there is at most one proof that two elements of a set are the same.
%% (Recall, a type is called a \defn{set} if it has \emph{unique identity proofs}; as a general principle, this is sometimes referred to as ``proof irrelevance'' or ``uniqueness of identity proofs''---two proofs of a single identity are the same.)

\section{Algebras}\label{sec:types-for-algebras}
A standard way to define algebraic structures in type theory is using record types.  However, we feel the dependent pair (or Sigma) type (\S\ref{ssec:dependent-pairs}) is more natural, as it corresponds semantically to the existential quantifier of logic. Therefore, many of the important types of the \ualib are defined as Sigma types. In this section, we use function types and Sigma types to define the types of \emph{operations} (\S\ref{sec:operation-type}), \emph{signatures} (\S\ref{signature-type}), \emph{algebras} (\S\ref{ssec:algebra-type}), and \emph{product algebras} (\S\ref{product-algebra-type}).

\subsection{Operation type}\label{sec:operation-type}
Here is how the type of \defn{operations} is defined in the \ualib.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
\>[0]\AgdaFunction{Op}\AgdaSpace{}%

\AgdaBound{A}\AgdaSymbol{)}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaSymbol{→}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{A}
\end{code}
\ccpad
The type \AgdaFunction{Op} encodes the arity of an operation as an arbitrary type \ab I : \ab 𝓥 ̇, which gives us a very general way to represent an operation as a function type with domain \ab I → \ab A (the type of ``tuples'') and codomain \ab A.  For example, the type of \defn{projections} is defined using the \af{Op} type, as follows.

The last two lines of the code block above codify the \ab i-th \ab I-ary projection operation on \ab A.

\subsection{Signature type}\label{signature-type}
We define the type of (algebraic) \emph{signatures} as follows.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%

\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{̇}}\<%

\AgdaSymbol{=}\AgdaSpace{}%

\AgdaBound{F}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaFunction{꞉}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{𝓞}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{̇}}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaFunction{,}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaSymbol{(}\AgdaBound{F}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaSymbol{→}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaBound{𝓥}\AgdaSpace{}%
\AgdaOperator{\AgdaFunction{̇}}\AgdaSymbol{)}\<%
\end{code}
\ccpad
Here \AgdaBound{𝓞} is the universe level of operation symbol types, while \AgdaBound{𝓥} is the universe level of arity types. We denote the first and second projections by \ai ∣ and \ai ∥ (\S\ref{ssec:dependent-pairs}) so if \ab 𝑆 is a signature, then \aiab{∣}{𝑆} denotes the type of \defn{operation symbols}, and \aiab{∥}{𝑆} denotes the \defn{arity} function. If \ab 𝑓~\as :~\af ∣~\ab 𝑆~\af ∣ is an operation symbol in the signature \ab 𝑆, then \aiab{∥}{𝑆} \ab 𝑓 is the arity of \ab 𝑓. For example, %% \subsubsection{Example}\label{Signatures.sssec:example}
here is the signature of \emph{monoids}, as a member of the type \AgdaFunction{Signature} \AgdaBound{𝓞} \AgdaBound{𝓤₀}.

One could call an inhabitant of \af{Algebra} \ab 𝑆 \AgdaBound{𝓤} as an ``∞-algebra'' because its domain can be an arbitrary type, say, \ab A \as : \ab 𝓤\af ̇ and need not be \emph{truncated} at some level (\S\ref{ssec:relation-truncation}). In particular, \ab A need not be an \emph{h-set} (as defined in \S\ref{ssec:relation-truncation}).%
%
\footnote{We could pause here to define the type of ``0-algebras,'' which are algebras whose domains are sets. This type is probably closer to what most of us think of when doing informal universal algebra. However, in the \ualib we have so far only needed to know that the domain of an algebra is a set in a handful of specific instances, so it seems preferable to work with general (∞-)algebras throughout the library and then assume \emph{uniqueness of identity proofs} explicitly where, and only where, a proof relies on this assumption.}

Next we define a convenient shorthand for the interpretation of an operation symbol. We use this often in the sequel.

Before proceeding, we define some convenient syntactic sugar. The type \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 itself has a type; it is \ab 𝓞 \as ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \as ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺ \af ̇ . This type appears quite often throughout the \ualib, so it is worthwhile to define the following shorthand for its universe level.

\subsection{Products of classes of algebras}\label{products-of-classes-of-algebras}
In the course of using Agda to formalize deep theorems in universal algebra (e.g., Birkhoff's HSP theorem), we were faced at a certain point with proving that the product of all subalgebras of algebras in a class 𝒦 belongs to the class SP(𝒦) of subalgebras of products of algebras in 𝒦.  That is, we had to prove \af ⨅ \ad S(\ab 𝒦) \af ∈ \ad{SP}(\ab 𝒦). This turned out to be surprisingly nontrivial. In fact, it wasn't even clear (at least to this author) how one should express the product of a whole class of algebras as a dependent type. After a number of failed attempts, the right type revealed itself in the form of the \af{class-product} function defined below. Now that we have the type in our hands, it seems quite natural, if not obvious.

First, we need a type that will serve to index a given class of algebras, as well as the product of all members of the class.

Notice that the second component of this dependent pair type is \ab𝑨 \af ∈ \ab 𝒦 \ad × (\ab X \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣). In previous versions of the \ualib, the second component was simply \ab 𝑨 \af ∈ \ab 𝒦. However, we realized that adding a mapping of type \ab X \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ is quite useful. The reason for this will become clear later; for now, suffice it to say that a map \ab X \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ may be viewed as a context and we want to keep the context completely general. Including this context map in the index type \af ℑ accomplishes this.

Forming the product over the index type \af ℑ requires a function that takes an index \ab i \as : \af ℑ and returns the corresponding algebra. Each \ab i \as : \af ℑ is a triple of the form (\ab 𝑨 , \ab p , \ab h), where \ab 𝑨~\as :~\af{Algebra}~\ab 𝓤~\ab 𝑆 and \ab p \as : \ab 𝑨 \af ∈ \ab 𝒦 and \ab h \as : \ab X \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \as ∣, so the function mapping an index to the corresponding algebra is simply the first projection.

\section{Congruence relation types}\label{sec:congr-relat-types}

This section describes parts of the \ualibCongruences module.\footnote{For more details, see \url{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Algebras.Congruences.html}.}

\subsection{Lifting relations and operation compatibility}\label{ssec:compatibility}
We say that a (unary) operation \ab f \as : \ab X \as → \ab X is \defn{compatible} with (or \defn{respects}, or \defn{preserves}) the binary relation \ab R on \ab X just in case \as ∀ \ab x, \ab y \as : X, we have \ab R \ab x \ab y \as →  \ab R (\ab f \ab x) (\ab f \ab y).

Now suppose \ab 𝓤, \ab 𝓥, and \ab 𝓦 are universes and assume the following typing judgments: \ab γ \as : \ab 𝓥\af ̇, \ab X \as : \ab 𝓤\af ̇. We \defn{lift} the definition of compatibility from unary to \ab γ-ary operations in the following natural way:\footnote{The ``lift'' we describe here is not to be confused with the one we described earlier, e.g., in Section~\ref{lifting-algebra-types}.} for all \ab u \ab v \as : \ab γ \as → \ab X (\ab γ-tuples of \ab X), we say that the pair \ab u \ab v is \ab R-related, and we write \AgdaFunction{lift-rel}~\ab R~\ab u~\ab v provided \as ∀ \ab i \as : \ab γ, \ab R (\ab u \ab i) (\ab v \ab i). The function \af{lift-rel} is defined as follows.

If \ab f \as : (\ab γ \as → \ab X) \as → \ab X is a \ab γ-ary operation on \ab X, we say that \ab f is \defn{compatible} with \ab R provided for all \ab u \ab v : \ab γ \as → \ab X, \af{lift-rel} \ab R \ab u \ab v implies \ab R (\ab f \ab u) (\ab f \ab v). We formalize this as follows.

We'll see this definition of compatibility at work very soon when we define congruence relations in the next subsection.

\subsection{Congruences as dependent pairs and records}
A \defn{congruence relation} of an algebra \ab 𝑨 is defined to be an equivalence relation that is compatible with the basic operations of \ab 𝑨.  This concept may be represented in type theory and formalized in \agda in a number of alternative ways.  For example, we define a Sigma type \af{Con} and a record type \af{Congruence} as shown below. Each definition captures the essence of the notion of congruence, and neither is more convenient than the other for all situations. (We will see examples later.)

We defined the zero relation \af{𝟎-rel} above (\S~\ref{binary-relations}). We now demonstrate how one constructs the \textit{trivial congruence} out of this relation. The relation \af{𝟎-rel} is equivalent to the identity relation \af ≡ and these are obviously both equivalences (see the \ualibEquality module for proof of \AgdaFunction{𝟎-IsEquivalence}).  Another easily proved fact is that \af{𝟎-rel} is compatible with all operations of all algebras.

\subsection{Quotient algebras}\label{quotient-algebras}

An important construction in universal algebra is the quotient of an algebra \ab 𝑨 with respect to a congruence relation \af θ of \ab 𝑨. This quotient is typically denote by \ab 𝑨 \af / \af θ and Agda allows us to define and express quotients using the standard notation.

\section{Present and future work}\label{sec:conclusions-and-future-work}

We are preparing two follow-up papers on more advanced aspects of the library. The first will cover homomorphism, terms, and subalgebras, and the second will cover free algebras, equational logic, equational classes of algebras (i.e., varieties), and Birkhoff's HSP theorem.

We completed the first major milestone of this project in January 2021, which was the first formal, machine-checked proof of Birkhoff's HSP theorem.  Our next goal is to support current mathematical research by formalizing some recently proved theorems. For example, we intend to formalize theorems about the computational complexity of decidable properties of algebraic structures. Part of this effort will naturally involve further work on the library itself, and may lead to new observations or discoveries in dependent type theory or homotopy type theory.

%% One natural question is whether there are any objects of our research that cannot be represented constructively in type theory. % and, if so, whether these have suitable constructive substitutes.
%% %Along these lines, %% we should revisit and perhaps refine our proof of Birkhoff's theorem. A
%% As mentioned in \S~\ref{sec:contributions}, a constructive version of Birkhoff's theorem was presented by Carlstr\"om in~\cite{Carlstrom:2008}. We would like to know, for example, how the two new hypotheses required by Carlstr\"om %% adds to the classical theorem in order to make it constructive 
%% compare with the assumptions we make in our Agda proof of this result.

Finally, as one of the goals of the \agdaualib project is to make computer formalization of mathematics more accessible to mathematicians working in universal algebra and model theory, we welcome feedback from the community and are happy to field questions about the \ualib, how it is installed, and how it can be used to prove theorems that are not yet part of the library.

\section{Homomorphism types}\label{sec:homomorphism-types}

This section describes the \ualibHomomorphisms module of the \agdaualib.

\subsection{Basic Definitions}\label{basic-definitions}

If \ab 𝑨 and \ab 𝑩 are algebraic structures in the signature \ab 𝑆, then a \defn{homomorphism}) (or \defn{morphism}) is a function \ab h \as : \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑩 \af ∣ from the domain of \ab 𝑨 to the domain of \ab 𝑩 that is compatible (or commutes) with all of the basic operations of the signature; that is, for all \ab{𝑓} \as : \af ∣ \ab 𝑆 \ab ∣ and all tuples \ab 𝒂 \as : \af ∥ \ab 𝑆 \af ∥ \ab 𝑓 \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ with values in \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣, the following equality holds:

\ab h ((\ab 𝑓 \as ̂ \ab 𝑨) \ab 𝒂) \af ≡ (\ab 𝑓 \af ̂ \ab 𝑩) (\ab h \af ∘ \ab 𝒂).

Recall, \ab h \af ∘ \ab 𝒂 is the tuple whose i-th component is \ab h (\ab 𝒂 \ab i).

To formalize the concept of homomorphism we first define a type representing the assertion that a function \ab h \as : \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑩 \af ∣, from the domain of \ab 𝑨 to the domain of \ab 𝑩, \defn{commutes} with an operation \ab 𝑓, interpreted in the algebras \ab 𝑨 and \ab 𝑩. Pleasingly, the defining equation of the previous paragraph can be expressed in Agda unadulterated.

Note the appearance of the shorthand \as ∀ \ab 𝒂 in the definition of \af{compatible-op-map}. We can get away with this in place of (\ab 𝒂 \as : \af ∥ \ab 𝑆 \af ∥ \ab 𝑓 \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣) since Agda is able to infer that
the \ab{𝒂} here must be a tuple on \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ of ``length'' \af ∥ \ab 𝑆 \af ∥ \ab 𝑓 (the arity of \ab 𝑓).

We now define the type \af{hom} \ab 𝑨 \ab 𝑩 of \defn{homomorphisms} from \ab 𝑨 to \ab 𝑩 by first defining the property \af{is-homomorphism} as follows.

The kernel of the canonical projection of \ab 𝑨 onto \ab 𝑨 \af / \ab θ is equal to θ, but since equality of inhabitants of certain types (like \af{Congruence} or \af{Rel}) can be a tricky business, we settle
for proving the containment \ab 𝑨 \af / \ab θ \af ⊆ \ab θ. Of the two containments, this is the easier one to prove; luckily it also happens to be the one we will need later.

\subsection{Product algebra type}\label{ssec:product-algebra-type}
%% This section describes some parts of the \ualibAlgProducts module of the \agdaualib.
Suppose we are given a type \ab I \as : \ab 𝓘 (of ``indices'') and an indexed family \ab 𝒜 \as : \ab I \as → \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 of \ab 𝑆-algebras. Then we define the \emph{product algebra}
\AgdaFunction{⨅} \AgdaBound{𝒜}
in the following natural way.%
%
\footnote{To distinguish the product algebra from the standard dependent function type available in the \agdastdlib, instead of \af ∏ (\ab{\textbackslash prod}) or \af Π (\ab{\textbackslash Pi}), we use the symbol \AgdaFunction{⨅}, which is typed in \agdamode as \ab{\textbackslash Glb}.}%

of ``tuples'', the \ab i-th components of which live in \af ∣ \ab 𝒜 \ab i \af ∣, and the operations are simply the operations of the \ab 𝒜~\ab i, interpreted component-wise.

The Birkhoff theorem involves products of entire arbitrary (nonindexed) classes of algebras, and it is not obvious how to handle this constructively, or whether it is even possible to do so without making extra assumptions about the class. (See~\cite{Carlstrom:2008} for a discussion of this issue.)  We describe our solution to this problem in \S~\ref{ssec:class-products-and-inclusions}.


\section{Quotient Types and Quotient Algebras}\label{sec:quotient-types-and-quotient-algebras}
For a binary relation \ab R on \ab A, we denote a single \ab R-class by \af [ \ab a \af ] \ab R (this denotes the class containing \ab a). We denote the type of all classes of a relation \ab R on \ab A by \af 𝒞 \as{\{} \ab A \as{\}} \as{\{} \ab R \as{\}}.  These are defined as in the \ualib as follows.

\subsection{Quotient extensionality}\label{ssec:quotient-extensionality}
We will need a subsingleton identity type for congruence classes over sets so that we can equate two classes, even when they are presented using different representatives. For this we assume that our relations are on sets, rather than arbitrary types. As mentioned earlier, this is equivalent to assuming that there is at most one proof that two elements of a set are the same.  The following \emph{class extensionality principle} accomplishes this for us.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
\input{aux/class-extensionality.tex}

We omit the proof. \seedocfordetails



\subsection{Compatibility}\label{ssec:compatibility}
We say that a (unary) operation \ab f \as : \ab X \as → \ab X is \defn{compatible} with (or \defn{respects}, or \defn{preserves}) the binary relation \ab R on \ab X just in case \as ∀ \ab x, \ab y \as : X, we have \ab R \ab x \ab y \as →  \ab R (\ab f \ab x) (\ab f \ab y).  Now suppose \ab 𝓤, \ab 𝓥, and \ab 𝓦 are universes and assume the following typing judgments: \ab γ \as : \ab 𝓥\af ̇, \ab X \as : \ab 𝓤\af ̇. We lift the definition of compatibility from unary to \ab γ-ary operations in the following obvious way: for all \ab u \ab v \as : \ab γ \as → \ab X (\ab γ-tuples of \ab X), we say that the pair \ab u \ab v is \ab R-related, and we write \AgdaFunction{lift-rel}~\ab R~\ab u~\ab v provided \as ∀ \ab i \as : \ab γ, \ab R (\ab u \ab i) (\ab v \ab i). The function \af{lift-rel} is defined as follows.

We'll see this definition of compatibility at work very soon when we define congruence relations in the next section.


\subsection{Congruence relations}\label{ssec:congr-relat}
This \ualibCongruences module of the \agdaualib defines a number of alternative representations of congruence relations of an algebra. We will only have occasion to use the Sigma and record type representations, which are defined as follows.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
  \input{aux/Congruences.tex}
\end{code}




\subsection{Quotient algebras}\label{ssec:quotient-algebras}
An important construction in universal algebra is the quotient of an algebra \ab 𝑨 with respect to a congruence relation \ab θ of \ab 𝑨. This quotient is typically denoted by \ab 𝑨 \as / \ab θ and Agda allows us to define and express quotients using this standard notation.
\ccpad

\textbf{Unicode Hints}. The \af ╱ symbol is typed in \ab{agda2-mode} as \ab{\textbackslash{}-\/-\/-}, plus \ab{C-f} a number of times.

The following elimination rule is sometimes useful when working with congruence classes.

\section{Homomorphisms, terms, and subalgebras}\label{sec:homom-terms-subalg}

\subsection{Homomorphisms}\label{ssec:homomorphisms}
%% This section describes parts of the \ualibHomBasic module of the \agdaualib.

The definition of homomorphism we use is a standard extensional one; that is, the homomorphism condition holds pointwise. This will become clearer once we have the formal definitions in hand. Generally speaking, though, we say that two functions \ab 𝑓 \ab 𝑔 \as : \ab X \as → \ab Y are extensionally equal if they are pointwise equal, that is, for all \ab x \as : \ab X we have \ab 𝑓 \ab x \af ≡ \ab 𝑔 \ab x.

To define \emph{homomorphism}, we first say what it means for an operation \ab 𝑓, interpreted in the algebras \ab 𝑨 and \ab 𝑩, to commute with a function \ab 𝑔 \as : \ab A \as → \ab B.
\ccpad
\begin{code}
\input{aux/hom1.tex}
\end{code}
\ccpad
Note the appearance of the shorthand \as ∀ \ab 𝒂 in the definition of \af{compatible-op-map}. We can get away with this in place of \ab 𝒂 \as : \af ∥ \ab 𝑆 \af ∥ \ab 𝑓 \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ since Agda is able to infer that the \ab 𝒂 here must be a tuple on \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ of ``length'' \af ∥ \ab 𝑆 \af ∥ \ab 𝑓 (the arity of \ab 𝑓).

Next we will define the type \af{hom} \ab 𝑨 \ab 𝑩 of \emph{homomorphisms} from \ab 𝑨 to \ab 𝑩 in terms of the property \af{is-homomorphism}.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
\input{aux/hom2.tex}

\subsection{Terms}\label{ssec:terms}

We define an inductive datatype called \ad{Term} which, not surprisingly, represents the type of \defn{terms} in a given signature. Here the type \ab X \as :~\ab 𝓧\af ̇ represents an arbitrary collection of variable symbols.

%% \subsection{The universal property}\label{ssec:the-universal-property}
The term algebra is \defn{absolutely free}, or \defn{universal}, for algebras in the signature 𝑆. That is, for every 𝑆-algebra 𝑨, every map \ab h \as :~\ab 𝑋 \as → \af ∣ \ab 𝑨 \af ∣ lifts to a homomorphism from \af 𝑻 \ab X to \ab 𝑨, and the induced homomorphism is unique. This is proved by induction on the structure of terms, as follows.

%% \subsubsection{Subuniverses}

\section{Equations and Varieties}\label{sec:equations-and-varieties}

Let \ab 𝑆 be a signature. By an \defn{identity} or \defn{equation} in \ab 𝑆 we mean an ordered pair of terms, written \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞, from the term algebra \af 𝑻 \ab X. If \ab 𝑨 is an \ab 𝑆-algebra we say that \ab 𝑨 \defn{satisfies} \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞 provided \ab 𝑝\af ̇ \ab 𝑨 \aod ≡ \ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 holds. In this situation, we write \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞 and say that \ab 𝑨 \defn{models} the identity \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab q. If \ab 𝒦 is a class of algebras of the same signature, we write \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≋ \ab q if \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞 for all \ab 𝑨 \aof ∈ \ab 𝒦.\footnote{Because a class of structures has a different type than a single structure, we must use a slightly different syntax to avoid overloading the relations \af ⊧ and \af ≈. As a reasonable alternative to what we would normally express informally as 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞, we have settled on \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≋ \ab q to denote this relation.}
%% To reiterate, if \ab 𝒦 is a class of \ab 𝑆-algebras, we write \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≋ \ab 𝑞 if every \ab 𝑨 \aof ∈ \ab 𝒦 satisfies \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞.}

\subsection{Types for Theories and Models}\label{ssec:types-for-theories-and-models}
%% We define types that represent \defn{identites} of terms in a given signature and what it means for a structure to satisfy, or \defn{model}, such identities.

The binary ``models'' relation \aof ⊧ relating algebras (or classes of algebras) to the identities that they satisfy is defined in the \ualibModelTheory module.  Agda supports the definition of infix operations and relations, and we use this to define \aof ⊧ so that we may write, e.g., \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≈ \ab q or \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≋ \ab q.

The \agdaualib makes available the standard notation \af{Th} \ab 𝒦 for the set of identities that hold for all algebras in a class \ab 𝒦, as well as \af{Mod} \ab ℰ for the class of algebras that satisfy all identities in a given set \ab ℰ.

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Equational logic types}\label{ssec:equational-logic-types}
We now state without proof some ``invariance'' properties of the models relation \aof ⊧ defined above.\footnote{The complete formal proofs in Agda are available in the \ualib source code files (\ualibsrc) and in the html documentation (\href{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.EquationalLogic.html}{\ab{ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.EquationalLogic.html}})} These are needed, for example, in the proof the Birkhoff HSP Theorem.
%% %% Specifically, we will prove the following facts (needed, for example, in the proof of Birkhoff's Theorem).
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item (\S\ref{sssec:algebraic-invariance}) \aof ⊧ is an \emph{algebraic invariant} (stable under isomorphism);
%%   \item (\S\ref{sssec:subalgebraic-invariance}) \aof ⊧ is a \emph{subalgebraic invariant} (stable under the taking of subalgebras);
%%   \item (\S\ref{sssec:product-invariance}) \aof ⊧ is stable under the taking of arbitrary products.
%% \end{itemize}
%% \subsubsection{Algebraic invariance}\label{sssec:algebraic-invariance}

The binary relation \aof ⊧ would be practically useless if it were not an \emph{algebraic invariant} (invariant under isomorphism). Before we prove this, let us clarify how one computes with (extensional) identities.
We have formally defined \ab 𝑨 \aof ⊧ \ab 𝑝 \aof ≈ \ab 𝑞, which represents the assertion that \ab p \aof ≈ \ab q holds when this identity is interpreted in the algebra \ab 𝑨; syntactically, \ab 𝑝 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 \aof ≡ \ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨.  Computationally, the expression \ab 𝑝 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 \aof ≡ \ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨 is interpreted as an \emph{extensional equality}, by which we mean that for each \emph{assignment function} \ab 𝒂 \as : \ab X \as → \aiab{∣}{𝑨}, assigning values in the domain of \ab 𝑨 to the variable symbols in \ab X, we have (\ab 𝑝 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨) \ab 𝒂 \aof ≡ (\ab 𝑞 \aof ̇ \ab 𝑨) \ab 𝒂.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
\input{aux/I-invariance.tex}
\end{code}
\ccpad
As the proof makes clear, we show \ab 𝑩 \aof ⊧ \ab p \aof ≈ \ab q by proving that \ab p\af ̇ \ab 𝑩 \aod ≡ \ab q\af ̇ \ab 𝑩 holds \emph{extensionally}, that is, \as ∀ \ab x, (\ab p\af ̇ \ab 𝑩) \ab x \aod ≡ (\ab q\af ̇ \ab 𝑩) \ab x.

We will also need to know that the \aof ⊧ relation is compatible with the \AgdaFunction{lift-alg} and \af{lower-alg} operations defined in \S\ref{ssec:the-lift-of-an-algebra}. We omit the easy proofs. \seedocfordetails

%% \subsubsection{Subalgebraic invariance}\label{sssec:subalgebraic-invariance}
An identity is modeled by a class of algebras if and only if it is modeled by all subalgebras of algebras in the class.  One direction is obvious, so we only show here the nontrivial direction; i.e., every term equation \ab p \aof ≈ \ab q that is modeled by \ab 𝒦 is also modeled by every subalgebra of every member of \ab 𝒦.

\subsection{Inductive types for closure operators}\label{sec:inductive-types-h-s-p-v}
%% This section presents the \ualibVarietiesVarieties module of the \agdaualib.

Fix a signature \ab 𝑆, let \ab 𝒦 be a class of \ab 𝑆-algebras, and define
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \af H \ab 𝒦 = algebras isomorphic to a homomorphic image of a members of \ab 𝒦;
\item
  \af S \ab 𝒦 = algebras isomorphic to a subalgebra of a member of \ab 𝒦;
\item
  \af P \ab 𝒦 = algebras isomorphic to a product of members of \ab 𝒦.
\end{itemize}
%% A straight-forward verification confirms that \af H, \af S, and \af P are \defn{closure operators} (expansive, monotone, and idempotent). A class \ab 𝒦 of \ab 𝑆-algebras is said to be \defn{closed under the taking of homomorphic images} provided \af H \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊆ \ab 𝒦. Similarly, \ab 𝒦 is \emph{closed under the taking of subalgebras} (resp., \emph{arbitrary products}) provided \af S \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊆ \ab 𝒦 (resp., \af P \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊆ \ab 𝒦). An algebra is a homomorphic image (resp., subalgebra; resp., product) of every algebra to which it is isomorphic. Thus, the class \af H \ab 𝒦 (resp., \af S \ab 𝒦; resp., \af P \ab 𝒦) is closed under isomorphism. The operators \af H, \af S, and \af P can be composed with one another repeatedly, forming yet more closure operators. 
A \defn{variety} is a class \ab 𝒦 of algebras in a fixed signature that is closed under the taking of homomorphic images (\af H), subalgebras (\af S), and arbitrary products (\af P). That is, \ab 𝒦 is a variety if and only if
\af H \af S \af P \ab 𝒦 \aof ⊆ \ab 𝒦.

The \ualibVarietiesVarieties module of the \agdaualib introduces three new inductive types that represent the closure operators \af H, \af S, \af P. Separately, an inductive type \af V is defined which represents closure under all three operators. These definitions have been fine-tuned to strike a balance between faithfully representing the desired semantics and facilitating proof by induction.
%% \\[5pt]
%% \textbf{Notation}. Recall, if \ab 𝓤\AgdaSpace{}\as{:}~\af{Universe} and \ab 𝑆\AgdaSpace{}\as{:}~\af{Signature} \ab 𝓞 \ab 𝓥, then \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 denotes the type of algebras with domains of type \ab 𝓤\af ̇.  Of course, the type \af{Algebra} \ab 𝓤 \ab 𝑆 itself has a type; it is \ab 𝓞 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺\af ̇.  The level of this type is frequently abbreviated in the sequel as follows: \AgdaFunction{OV}\AgdaSpace{}\ab 𝓤 := \ab 𝓞 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓥 \af ⊔ \ab 𝓤 \af ⁺.
%% The inductive types that we have found most useful for representing the fact that a class of algebras is closed under the taking of homomorphic images is defined as follows.

%% We have found the following to be the most useful inductive type for representing classes of algebras closed under arbitrary products.

%% Recall, a class \ab 𝒦 of \ab 𝑆-algebras is called a \defn{variety} if it is closed under each of the closure operators \ad H, \ad S, and \ad P. 
The operator that corresponds to closure with respect to \ad H\ad S\ad P is often denoted by 𝕍; we represent it by the inductive type \ad V.\footnote{See the \ualibVarietiesVarieties module or the html documentation at\\ \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.Varieties.html}{ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.Varieties.html} for the definition.}

Thus, if \ab 𝒦 is a class of \ab 𝑆-algebras, then the \defn{variety generated by} \ab 𝒦---that is, the smallest class that contains \ab 𝒦 and is closed under \ad H, \ad S, and \ad P---is \ad V \ab 𝒦.




\subsection{Class products, PS ⊆ SP and ⨅ S ∈ SP}\label{ssec:class-products-and-inclusions}
We need to establish two important facts about the closure operators defined in the last section.  The first is the inclusion \ad P\ad S(\ab 𝒦) ⊆ \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦). The second requires that we construct the product of all subalgebras of algebras in an arbitrary class, and then show that this product belongs to \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦).  These are both nontrivial formalization tasks with rather lengthy proofs, which we omit.  However, the interested reader can view the complete proofs on the web page \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.Varieties.html}{ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.Varieties.html} or by looking at the source code of the \ualibVarieties module at \href{https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/UALib/Varieties/Varieties.lagda}{gitlab.com/ualib}.

Here is the formal statement of the first goal, along with the first few lines of proof.\footnote{For legibility we use \AgdaFunction{ov𝓾} as a shorthand for
  \AgdaGeneralizable{𝓞} \AgdaOperator{\AgdaPrimitive{⊔}}
  \AgdaGeneralizable{𝓥} \AgdaOperator{\AgdaPrimitive{⊔}}
  \AgdaBound{𝓤} \AgdaOperator{\AgdaPrimitive{⁺}}.}
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
  \input{aux/classinclusion.tex}
\end{code}
\ccpad
Evidently, the proof is by induction on the form of an inhabitant of \ad P\ad S(\ab 𝒦), handling in turn each way such an inhabitant can be constructed. \seedocfordetails

%% More interesting, perhaps, is the second goal which is to formally implement the product of all subalgebras of algebras in a given class and then to show that this product belongs to \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦).

%% \subsubsection{The product of a class of algebras}\label{sssec:the-product-of-a-class-of-algebras}
Next we formally state and prove that, given an arbitrary class \ab 𝒦 of algebras, the product of all algebras in the class \ad S(\ab 𝒦) belongs to \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦).\footnote{This turned out to be a nontrivial exercise. In fact, it is not even immediately obvious (at least not to this author) how one should express the product of an entire arbitrary class of algebras as a dependent type. However, after a number of failed attempts, the right type revealed itself. Now that we have it, it seems almost obvious.}
The type that serves to index the class (and the product of its members) is the following.

It follows from \af{V-id1} that, if \ab 𝒦 is a class of structures, then the collection of identities modeled by all structures in \ab 𝒦 is precisely the collection of identities modeled by all structures in \af V \ab 𝒦.  The latter is denoted \AgdaFunction{Th}(\AgdaDatatype{V} \AgdaBound{𝒦}).

\subsection{The free algebra in theory}\label{ssec:the-free-algebra-in-theory}
In this section, we formalize, for a given class \ab 𝒦 of \ab 𝑆-algebras, the (relatively) \defn{free algebra in} \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦) \defn{over} \ab X. Let \af Θ(\ab 𝒦, \ab 𝑨) := \{\ab θ \af ∈ \af{Con} \ab 𝑨 \as : \ab 𝑨 \af / \ab θ \af ∈ \ad S \ab 𝒦\} and \af ψ(\ab 𝒦, \ab 𝑨) := \af ⋂ \af Θ(\ab 𝒦, \ab𝑨).
%% The free algebra is constructed by applying these definitions to the special case in which \ab 𝑨 is the term algebra \af 𝑻 \ab X of \ab 𝑆-terms over \ab X.  
Since the term algebra \af 𝑻 \ab X is free for (and in) the class \af{𝒜𝓁ℊ}(\ab 𝑆) of all \ab 𝑆-algebras, it is free for every subclass \ab 𝒦 of \af{𝒜𝓁ℊ}(\ab 𝑆). Although \af 𝑻 \ab X is not necessarily a member of \ab 𝒦, if we form the quotient \af 𝔉 \as := (\ab 𝑻 \ab X) \af / \af ψ(\ab 𝒦, \af 𝑻 \ab X), of \af 𝑻 \ab X modulo the congruence

\af ψ(\ab 𝒦, \af 𝑻 \ab 𝑋) := \af ⋂ \{\ab θ \af ∈ \af{Con} (\af 𝑻 \ab X) \as : (\af 𝑻 \ab X) \af / \ab θ \af ∈ \ad S(\ab 𝒦)\},\\
then it is not hard to see that \af 𝔉 is a subdirect product of the algebras in \as{\{}( \af 𝑻 \ab 𝑋) \aof ╱ \ab θ \as{\}}, where \ab θ ranges over \af Θ(\ab 𝒦, \af 𝑻 \ab X), so \af 𝔉 belongs to \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦), and it follows that \af 𝔉 satisfies all the identities modeled by 𝒦.  Indeed, for each pair \ab p \ab q \as : \af 𝑻 \ab X, if \ab 𝒦 \af ⊧ \ab p \af ≈ \ab q, then \ab p and \ab q must belong to the same \af ψ(\ab 𝒦, \af 𝑻 \ab X)-class, so \ab p and \ab q are identified in the quotient \af 𝔉.

The algebra \af 𝔉 so defined is called the \defn{free algebra over} \ab 𝒦 \defn{generated by} \ab X and (because of what we just observed) we say that \af 𝔉 is free \emph{in} \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦).

\subsection{The free algebra in Agda}\label{ssec:the-free-algebra-in-agda}

To represent \af 𝔉 as a type in \agda, we must formally construct the congruence \af ψ(\ab 𝒦, \af 𝑻 \ab 𝑋).
%% which, recall, is defined as follows:\\
%% \af ψ(\ab 𝒦, \af 𝑻 \ab 𝑋) := \af ⋂ \af Θ(\ab 𝒦, \af 𝑻 \ab X) := \af ⋂ \{\ab θ \af ∈ \af{Con} (\af 𝑻 \ab X) \as : \ab 𝑨 \af / \ab θ \af ∈ \ad S \ab 𝒦\}.\\

%% The inhabitants of this Sigma type represent algebras \ab 𝑨 \af ∈ \ab 𝒦 such that there exists a surjective homomorphism \ab ϕ \as : \af{hom} (\af 𝑻 \ab X) \ab 𝑨. Thus, \af{𝑻img} represents the collection of all homomorphic images of \af 𝑻 \ab X that belong to \ab 𝒦.  Of course, this is the entire class \ab 𝒦, since the term algebra is absolutely free. Nonetheless, this representation of \ab 𝒦 is useful since it endows each element with extra information.  Indeed, each inhabitant of \af{𝑻img} \ab 𝒦 is a quadruple, (\ab 𝑨 , \ab ϕ , \ab{ka}, \ab p), where \ab 𝑨 is an \ab 𝑆-algebra, \ab ϕ is a homomorphism from \af 𝑻 \ab X to \ab 𝑨, \ab{ka} is a proof that \ab 𝑨 belongs to \ab 𝒦, and \ab p is a proof that the underlying map \af ∣ \ab ϕ \af ∣ is epic.

\subsection{HSP Lemmas}\label{ssec:hsp-lemmas}
This subsection gives formal statements of four lemmas that we will string together in \S\ref{ssec:hsp-theorem} to complete the proof of Birkhoff's theorem.

The first hurdle is the \af{lift-alg-V-closure} lemma, which says that if an algebra \ab 𝑨 belongs to the variety 𝕍, then so does its lift. This dispenses with annoying universe level problems that arise later---a minor technical issue, but the proof is long and tedious, not to mention uninteresting. \seedocfordetails
The next fact that must be formalized is the inclusion \ad S\ad P(\ab 𝒦) \af ⊆ \ad V(\ab 𝒦), which also suffers from the unfortunate defect of being boring, so we omit this one as well.

%% \subsubsection{𝔉 ↪ ℭ}\label{sssec:lemma-3}
After these first two lemmas are formally verified (see~\cite{DeMeo:2021} or \ualibdotorg for proofs), we arrive at a step in the formalization of Birkhoff's theorem that turns out to be surprisingly nontrivial. We must show that the relatively free algebra \af 𝔉 embeds in the product \af ℭ of all subalgebras of algebras in the given class \ab 𝒦.  We begin by constructing \af ℭ, using the class-product types described in \S\ref{ssec:class-products-and-inclusions}.

\subsection{The HSP Theorem}\label{ssec:hsp-theorem}
%% This section presents the \ualibTheorem module of the \agdaualib that puts together all the pieces we have developed above to complete the formal proof of the HSP theorem in type theory.
It is now all but trivial to use what we have already proved and piece together a complete proof of Birkhoff's celebrated HSP theorem asserting that every variety is defined by a set of identities.
\ccpad
\begin{code}%
\input{aux/birkhoff-theorem.tex}
\end{code}
\ccpad
Some readers might worry that we haven't quite achieved our goal because what we just proved (birkhoff) is not an ``if and only if'' assertion. Those fears are quickly put to rest by noting that the converse---that every equational class is closed under HSP---is straightforward, as discussed in \S\ref{equation-preservation}. Indeed, in the \ualibPreservation module of the \ualib we provide proofs of
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.Preservation.html\#964}{(H-id1)}
  \ab 𝒦 \af ⊧ \ab p \af ≋ \ab q \as → \ad H \ab 𝒦 \af ⊧ \ab p \af ≋ \ab q
\item
  \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.Preservation.html\#2592}{(S-id1)}
  \ab 𝒦 \af ⊧ \ab p \af ≋ \ab q \as → \ad S \ab 𝒦 \af ⊧ \ab p \af ≋ \ab q
\item
  \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io/UALib.Varieties.Preservation.html\#4111}{(P-id1)}
  \ab 𝒦 \af ⊧ \ab p \af ≋ \ab q \as → \ad P \ab 𝒦 \af ⊧ \ab p \af ≋ \ab q
\end{itemize}
From these it follows that every equational class is a variety.




\section{Current and future directions}\label{sec:conclusions-and-future-work}

Now that we have accomplished our initial goal of formalizing Birkhoff's HSP theorem in \agda, our next goal is to support current mathematical research by formalizing some recently proved theorems. For example, we intend to formalize theorems about the computational complexity of decidable properties of algebraic structures. Part of this effort will naturally involve further work on the library itself, and may lead to new observations about dependent type theory.

One natural question is whether there are any objects of our research that cannot be represented constructively in type theory. % and, if so, whether these have suitable constructive substitutes.
%Along these lines, %% we should revisit and perhaps refine our proof of Birkhoff's theorem. A
As mentioned in \S~\ref{sec:contributions}, a constructive version of Birkhoff's theorem was presented by Carlstr\"om in~\cite{Carlstrom:2008}. We should determine how the two new hypotheses required by Carlstr\"om %% adds to the classical theorem in order to make it constructive 
compare with the assumptions we make in our Agda proof.

Finally, as one of the goals of the \agdaualib project is to make computer formalization of mathematics more accessible to mathematicians working in universal algebra and model theory, we welcome feedback from the community and are happy to field questions about the \ualib, how it is installed, and how it can be used to prove theorems that are not yet part of the library.
