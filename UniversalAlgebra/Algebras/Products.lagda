### <a id="product-algebras">Product Algebras</a>

This is the [Algebras.Products][] module of the [Agda Universal Algebra Library][].

\begin{code}

{-# OPTIONS --without-K --exact-split --safe #-}

module Algebras.Products where

open import Algebras.Basic public

module products {𝑆 : Signature 𝓞 𝓥} where

\end{code}

From now on, the modules of the [UniversalAlgebra][] library will assume a fixed signature `𝑆 : Signature 𝓞 𝓥`.

Recall the informal definition of a *product* of `𝑆`-algebras. Given a type `I : Type 𝓘` and a family `𝒜 : I → Algebra 𝓤 𝑆`, the *product* `⨅ 𝒜` is the algebra whose domain is the Cartesian product `Π 𝑖 ꞉ I , ∣ 𝒜 𝑖 ∣` of the domains of the algebras in `𝒜`, and whose operations are defined as follows: if `𝑓` is a `J`-ary operation symbol and if `𝑎 : Π 𝑖 ꞉ I , J → 𝒜 𝑖` is an `I`-tuple of `J`-tuples such that `𝑎 𝑖` is a `J`-tuple of elements of `𝒜 𝑖` (for each `𝑖`), then `(𝑓 ̂ ⨅ 𝒜) 𝑎 := (i : I) → (𝑓 ̂ 𝒜 i)(𝑎 i)`.

In [UniversalAlgebra][] a *product of* `𝑆`-*algebras* is represented by the following type.

\begin{code}

 ⨅ : {𝓘 : Level}{I : Type 𝓘 }(𝒜 : I → Algebra 𝓤 𝑆 ) → Algebra (𝓘 ⊔ 𝓤) 𝑆

 ⨅{I = I} 𝒜 = (Π i ꞉ I , ∣ 𝒜 i ∣) ,            -- domain of the product algebra
              λ 𝑓 𝑎 i → (𝑓 ̂ 𝒜 i) λ x → 𝑎 x i   -- basic operations of the product algebra

\end{code}

(Alternative acceptable notation for the domain of the product is `∀ i → ∣ 𝒜 i ∣`.)

The type just defined is the one that will be used throughout the [UniversalAlgebra][] library whenever the product of an indexed collection of algebras (of type `Algebra`) is required.  However, for the sake of completeness, here is how one could define a type representing the product of algebras inhabiting the record type `algebra`.

\begin{code}

 open algebra

 ⨅' : {𝓘 : Level}{I : Type 𝓘 }(𝒜 : I → algebra 𝓤 𝑆) → algebra (𝓘 ⊔ 𝓤) 𝑆

 ⨅' 𝒜 = record { univ = ∀ i → univ (𝒜 i) ;                 -- domain
                 op = λ 𝑓 𝑎 i → (op (𝒜 i)) 𝑓 λ x → 𝑎 x i } -- basic operations

\end{code}



**Notation**. Given a signature `𝑆 : Signature 𝓞 𝓥`, the type `Algebra 𝓤 𝑆` has type `Type(𝓞 ⊔ 𝓥 ⊔ lsuc 𝓤)`.  Such types occur so often in the [UniversalAlgebra][] library that we define the following shorthand for their universes.

\begin{code}

 ov : Level → Level
 ov 𝓤 = 𝓞 ⊔ 𝓥 ⊔ lsuc 𝓤

\end{code}



#### <a id="products-of-classes-of-algebras">Products of classes of algebras</a>

An arbitrary class `𝒦` of algebras is represented as a predicate over the type `Algebra 𝓤 𝑆`, for some universe level `𝓤` and signature `𝑆`. That is, `𝒦 : Pred (Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) 𝓦`, for some type `𝓦`. Later we will formally state and prove that the product of all subalgebras of algebras in `𝒦` belongs to the class `SP(𝒦)` of subalgebras of products of algebras in `𝒦`. That is, `⨅ S(𝒦) ∈ SP(𝒦 )`. This turns out to be a nontrivial exercise.

To begin, we need to define types that represent products over arbitrary (nonindexed) families such as `𝒦` or `S(𝒦)`. Observe that `Π 𝒦` is certainly not what we want.  For recall that `Pred (Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) 𝓦` is just an alias for the function type `Algebra 𝓤 𝑆 → Type 𝓦`, and the semantics of the latter takes `𝒦 𝑨` (and `𝑨 ∈ 𝒦`) to mean that `𝑨` belongs to the class `𝒦`. Thus, by definition,

`Π 𝒦 = Π 𝑨 ꞉ (Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) , 𝒦 𝑨` &nbsp; &nbsp; `=` &nbsp; &nbsp; `∀ (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) → 𝑨 ∈ 𝒦`,

which asserts that every inhabitant of the type `Algebra 𝓤 𝑆` belongs to `𝒦`.  Evidently this is not the product algebra that we seek.

What we need is a type that serves to index the class `𝒦`, and a function `𝔄` that maps an index to the inhabitant of `𝒦` at that index. But `𝒦` is a predicate (of type `(Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) → Type 𝓦`) and the type `Algebra 𝓤 𝑆` seems rather nebulous in that there is no natural indexing class with which to "enumerate" all inhabitants of `Algebra 𝓤 𝑆` belonging to `𝒦`.<sup>[1](Algebras.Product.html#fn1)</sup>

The solution is to essentially take `𝒦` itself to be the indexing type, at least heuristically that is how one can view the type `ℑ` that we now define.<sup>[2](Algebras.Product.html#fn2)</sup>

\begin{code}

 module _ {𝒦 : Pred (Algebra 𝓤 𝑆)(ov 𝓤)} where
  ℑ : Type (ov 𝓤)
  ℑ = Σ 𝑨 ꞉ (Algebra _ 𝑆) , (𝑨 ∈ 𝒦)

\end{code}

Taking the product over the index type `ℑ` requires a function that maps an index `i : ℑ` to the corresponding algebra.  Each `i : ℑ` is a pair, `(𝑨 , p)`, where `𝑨` is an algebra and `p` is a proof that `𝑨` belongs to `𝒦`, so the function mapping an index to the corresponding algebra is simply the first projection.

\begin{code}

  𝔄 : ℑ → Algebra 𝓤 𝑆
  𝔄 i = ∣ i ∣

\end{code}

Finally, we define `class-product` which represents the product of all members of 𝒦.

\begin{code}

  class-product : Algebra (ov 𝓤) 𝑆
  class-product = ⨅ 𝔄

\end{code}

If `p : 𝑨 ∈ 𝒦`, we view the pair `(𝑨 , p) ∈ ℑ` as an *index* over the class, so we can think of `𝔄 (𝑨 , p)` (which is simply `𝑨`) as the projection of the product `⨅ 𝔄` onto the `(𝑨 , p)`-th component.
