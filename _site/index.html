<p>10 Oct 2020, version of 11 October 2020, 15:10.</p>

<p><a href="https://williamdemeo.gitlab.io">William DeMeo</a></p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>To support formalization in type theory of research level mathematics in
universal algebra and related fields, we are developing a software
library, called the <a href="https://github.com/UniversalAlgebra/agda-ualib/">Agda Universal Algebra
Library</a>
(<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">agda-ualib</a> ). Our library
contains formal statements and proofs of some of the core, foundational
definitions and results universal algebra and is written in
<a href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a> is a programming
language and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant">proof
assistant</a>, or
“interactive theorem prover” (ITP), that not only supports dependent and
inductive types, but also provides powerful <em>proof tactics</em> for proving
things about the objects that inhabit these types.</p>

<h3 id="vision-and-goals">Vision and Goals</h3>

<p>The idea for the the Agda Universal Algebra Library
(<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">agda-ualib</a>) originated with
the observation that, on the one hand a number of basic and important
constructs in universal algebra can be defined recursively, and theorems
about them proved inductively, while on the other hand the <em>types</em> (of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a> —in
particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">dependent
types</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_type_theory#Inductive_types">inductive
types</a>)
make possible elegant formal representations of recursively defined
objects, and constructive (<em>computable</em>) proofs of their properties.
These observations suggest that there is much to gain from implementing
universal algebra in a language that facilitates working with dependent
and inductive types.</p>

<h4 id="primary-goals">Primary Goals</h4>

<p>The first goal of the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">agda-ualib</a> project is to
demonstrate that it is possible to express the foundations of universal
algebra in type theory and to formalize (and formally verify) the
foundations in the Agda programming language. We will formalize a
substantial portion of the edifice on which our own mathematical
research depends, and demonstrate that our research can also be
expressed in type theory and formally implemented in such a way that we
and other working mathematicians can understand and verify the results.
The resulting library will also serve to educate our peers, and
encourage and help them to formally verify their own mathematics
research.</p>

<p>Our field is deep and wide and codifying all of its foundations may seem
like a daunting task and possibly risky investment of time and
resources. However, we believe our subject is well served by a new,
modern, <a href="constructive%20mathematics">constructive</a> presentation of its
foundations. Our new presentation expresses the foundations of universal
algebra in the language of type theory, and uses the Agda proof
assistant to codify and formally verify everything.</p>

<h4 id="secondary-goals">Secondary Goals</h4>

<p>We wish to emphasize that our ultimate objective is not merely to
translate existing results into a more modern and formal language.
Indeed, one important goal is to develop a system that is useful for
conducting research in mathematics, and that is how we intend to use our
library once we have achieved our immediate objective of implementing
the basic foundational core of universal algebra in Agda.</p>

<p>To this end, our intermediate-term objectives include</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing domain specific “proof tactics” to express the idioms of universal algebra,</li>
  <li>incorporating automated proof search for universal algebra, and</li>
  <li>formalizing theorems emerging from our own mathematics research,</li>
  <li>documenting the resulting software libraries so they are usable by
other working mathematicians.</li>
</ul>

<p>For our own mathematics research, we believe a proof assistant equipped with specialized libraries for universal algebra, as well as domain-specific tactics to automate proof idioms of our field, will be extremely useful. Thus, a secondary goal is to demonstrate (to ourselves and colleagues) the utility of such libraries and tactics for proving new theorems.</p>

<h3 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h3>

<p>This document describes the Agda Universal Algebra Library
(<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">agda-ualib</a>) in enough
detail so that working mathematicians (and possibly some normal people,
too) might be able to learn enough about Agda and its libraries to put
them to use when creating, formalizing, and verifying new mathematics.</p>

<p>While there are no strict prerequisites, we expect anyone with an
interest in this work will have been motivated by prior exposure to
universal algebra, as presented in, say, Bergman:2012 or McKenzie:1987,
and to a lesser extent category theory, as presented in
<a href="https://categorytheory.gitlab.io">categorytheory.gitlab.io</a> or
Riehl:2017.</p>

<p>Some prior exposure to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type
theory</a> and Agda would be
helpful, but even without this background one might still be able to get
something useful out of this by referring to the appendix and glossary,
while simultaneously consulting one or more of the references mentioned
in references to fill in gaps as needed.</p>

<p>Finally, it is assumed that while reading these materials the reader is
actively experimenting with Agda using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> with its
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/emacs-mode.html">agda2-mode</a>
extension installed.</p>

<h3 id="installing-the-library">Installing the library</h3>

<p>The main repository for the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">agda-ualib</a> is
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io</a> (which will become publicly
available again in the summer of 2020).</p>

<p>There are installation instructions in the main README.md file in that
repository, but really all you need to do is have a working Agda (and
agda2-mode) installation and clone the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">agda-ualib</a> repository with,
e.g.,</p>

<p>``` {.sourceCode .bash}
git clone git@gitlab.com:ualib/ualib.gitlab.io.git</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
OR

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
git clone https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(We assume you have
<a href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a> and
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/emacs-mode.html">agda2-mode</a>
installed on your machine. If not, follow the directions on <a href="Agda">the main
Agda website</a> to install them.)</p>

<h3 id="unicode-hints">Unicode hints</h3>

<p>At the end of each chapter of this documentation we show how to produce
in Emacs
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/emacs-mode.html">agda2-mode</a>
some of the fancy unicode characters that we use in our code. For
example, we might say “type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\MCI</code> to produce the symbol 𝓘”. We hope
these occasional hints are convenient for the reader, but they are not
meant to be comprehensive. Instead, information about unicode symbols is
readily available in Emacs
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/emacs-mode.html">agda2-mode</a>;
simply place the cursor on the character of interest and enter the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x describe-char</code>; alternatively, use the shortcut
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-m h d c</code>. To see a full list of available characters, enter
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x describe-input-method</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-h I</code>).</p>

<h2 id="options-and-imports">Options and imports</h2>

<p>All but the most trivial Agda programs begin by setting some options
that effect how Agda behaves and importing from existing libraries
(e.g., the <a href="https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/">Agda Standard Library</a>
or, in our case, MHE’s <a href="%3Chttps://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology%3E%60_">Type
Topology</a>
library). In particular, logical axioms and deduction rules can be
specified according to what one wishes to assume.</p>

<p>For example, we begin our agda development with the line</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="14204" class="Symbol">{-#</a> <a id="14208" class="Keyword">OPTIONS</a> <a id="14216" class="Pragma">--without-K</a> <a id="14228" class="Pragma">--exact-split</a> <a id="14242" class="Pragma">--safe</a> <a id="14249" class="Symbol">#-}</a>

<a id="14254" class="Keyword">module</a> <a id="14261" href="ualib.html" class="Module">ualib</a> <a id="14267" class="Keyword">where</a>
</pre>

<p>This specifies Agda <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPTIONS</code> that we will use throughout the library.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">without-K</code> disables <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/axiom+K+%28type+theory%29">Streicher’s K axiom</a>;
see also the <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/language/without-k.html">section on axiom K</a>
in the <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/language">Agda Language Reference</a> manual.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exact-split</code> makes Agda accept only those definitions that behave
like so-called <em>judgmental</em> or <em>definitional</em> equalities. MHE
explains this by saying it “makes sure that pattern matching
corresponds to Martin-Löf eliminators;” see also the <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/tools/command-line-options.html#pattern-matching-and-equality">Pattern
matching and equality
section</a>
of the <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/tools/">Agda Tools</a>
documentation.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safe</code> ensures that nothing is postulated outright—every
non-MLTT axiom has to be an explicit assumption (e.g., an argument to a function or module);
see also <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/tools/command-line-options.html#cmdoption-safe">this section</a>

</ul>

<h3 id="universes">Universes</h3>

<p>We import the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Universes</code> module from MHE’s <a href="%3Chttps://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology%3E%60_">Type Topology</a>
library.</p>

<pre class="Agda">

</pre>

<p>This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Universes</code> module provides, among other things, an elegant notation for type universes that we have fully adopted and we use MHE’s notation throughout the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">UALib</a>.</p>

<p>MHE has authored an outstanding set of notes on <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/HoTT-UF-Agda.html">HoTT-UF-in-Agda</a> called <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/index.html">Introduction to Univalent Foundations of Mathematics with Agda</a>. We highly recommend these notes to anyone wanting more details than we provide here about MLTT and the Univalent Foundations/HoTT extensions thereof.</p>

<p>Following MHE, we refer to universes using capitalized script letters 𝓤,𝓥,𝓦,𝓣. We add a few more to Martin’s list.</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="16650" class="Keyword">variable</a> <a id="16659" href="ualib.html#16659" class="Generalizable">𝓘</a> <a id="16661" href="ualib.html#16661" class="Generalizable">𝓙</a> <a id="16663" href="ualib.html#16663" class="Generalizable">𝓚</a> <a id="16665" href="ualib.html#16665" class="Generalizable">𝓛</a> <a id="16667" href="ualib.html#16667" class="Generalizable">𝓜</a> <a id="16669" href="ualib.html#16669" class="Generalizable">𝓝</a> <a id="16671" href="ualib.html#16671" class="Generalizable">𝓞</a> <a id="16673" href="ualib.html#16673" class="Generalizable">𝓠</a> <a id="16675" href="ualib.html#16675" class="Generalizable">𝓡</a> <a id="16677" href="ualib.html#16677" class="Generalizable">𝓢</a> <a id="16679" href="ualib.html#16679" class="Generalizable">𝓧</a> <a id="16681" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="16683" href="Agda.Primitive.html#423" class="Postulate">Universe</a>
</pre>

<p>In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Universes</code> module, MHE defines the ̇ operator which maps a universe 𝓤 (i.e., a level) to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set 𝓤</code>, and the latter has type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set (lsuc 𝓤)</code>.</p>

<p>The level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lzero</code> is renamed 𝓤₀, so 𝓤₀ ̇ is an alias for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set lzero</code> (which, incidentally, corresponds to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sort 0</code> in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean</a>).</p>

<p>Although it is nice and short, we won’t show all of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Universes</code> module here. Instead, we highlight the few lines of code from MHE’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Universes.lagda</code> file that makes available the notational devices that we just described and will adopt throughout the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">UALib</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, 𝓤 ̇ is simply an alias for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set 𝓤</code>, and we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set 𝓤 : Set (lsuc 𝓤)</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set (lsuc lzero)</code> is denoted by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set 𝓤₀ ⁺</code> which (MHE and) we denote by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀ ⁺ ̇</code>.</p>

<p>The following dictionary translates between standard Agda syntax and MHE/<a href="https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io">UALib</a> notation.</p>

<pre><code class="language-agda">Agda              MHE/UALib
====              ==============
Level             Universe
lzero             𝓤₀
𝓤 : Level         𝓤 : Universe
Set lzero         𝓤₀ ̇
Set 𝓤             𝓤 ̇
lsuc lzero        𝓤₀ ⁺
lsuc 𝓤            𝓤 ⁺
Set (lsuc lzero)  𝓤₀ ⁺ ̇
Set (lsuc 𝓤)      𝓤 ⁺ ̇
Setω              𝓤ω
</code></pre>

<p>To justify the introduction of this somewhat nonstandard notation for
universe levels, MHE points out that the Agda library uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Level</code> for
universes (so what we write as 𝓤 ̇ is written <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set 𝓤</code> in standard Agda),
but in univalent mathematics the types in 𝓤 ̇ need not be sets, so the
standard Agda notation can be misleading. Furthermore, the standard
notation places emphasis on levels rather than universes themselves.</p>

<p>There will be many occasions calling for a type living in the universe
that is the least upper bound of two universes, say, 𝓤 ̇ and 𝓥 ̇ . The
universe 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥 ̇ denotes this least upper bound. Here 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥 is used to
denote the universe level corresponding to the least upper bound of the
levels 𝓤 and 𝓥, where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_⊔_</code> is an Agda primitive designed for
precisely this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="public-imports">Public imports</h3>

<p>Next we import other parts of MHE’s <a href="%3Chttps://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology%3E%60_">Type
Topology</a>
library, using the Agda directive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code>, which means these imports
will be available wherever the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prelude</code> module in imported. We describe
some of these imports later, when making use of them, but we don’t
describe each one in detail. (The interested or confused reader should

<p>For the dependent pair type, we prefer the notation <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Σ x ꞉ X , y</code>, which
is more pleasing (and more standard in the literature) than Agda’s
default syntax (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Σ λ(x ꞉ X) → y</code>), and MHE has a useful trick that makes
the preferred notation available by making index type explicit.</p>

<pre><code class="language-agda">infixr -1 -Σ
-Σ : {𝓤 𝓥 : Universe} (X : 𝓤 ̇ ) (Y : X → 𝓥 ̇ ) → 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥 ̇
-Σ X Y = Σ Y
syntax -Σ X (λ x → y) = Σ x ꞉ X , y -- type `꞉` as `\:4`
</code></pre>

<div class="admonition warning">

The symbol ꞉ is not the same as : despite how similar they may appear.
The correct colon in the expression `Σ x ꞉ X , y` above is obtained by
typing `\:4` in
[agda2-mode](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/emacs-mode.html).

</div>

<p>MHE explains Sigma induction as follows: “To prove that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A z</code> holds for
all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z : Σ Y</code>, for a given property <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, we just prove that we have
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A (x , y)</code> for all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y : Y x</code>. This is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> induction
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> elimination (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uncurry</code>).</p>

<pre><code class="language-agda">Σ-induction : {X : 𝓤 ̇ }{Y : X → 𝓥 ̇ }{A : Σ Y → 𝓦 ̇ }
 →            ((x : X)(y : Y x) → A (x , y))
              -------------------------------
 →            ((x , y) : Σ Y) → A (x , y)
Σ-induction g (x , y) = g x y

curry : {X : 𝓤 ̇ }{Y : X → 𝓥 ̇ }{A : Σ Y → 𝓦 ̇ }
 →      (((x , y) : Σ Y ) → A (x , y))
       ---------------------------------
 →      ((x : X) (y : Y x) → A (x , y))
curry f x y = f (x , y)
</code></pre>

<p>The special case in which the type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code> doesn’t depend on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is of
course the usual Cartesian product.</p>

<pre><code class="language-agda">infixr 30 _×_
_×_ : 𝓤 ̇ → 𝓥 ̇ → 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥 ̇
X × Y = Σ x ꞉ X , Y
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h3 id="dependent-function-type">Dependent function type</h3>

<p>To make the syntax for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Π</code> conform to the standard notation for “Pi

<h3 id="application">Application</h3>

<p>An important tool that we use often in Agda proofs is application of a
function to an identification <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ x'</code>. We apply the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ap</code> operator
to obtain the identification <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ap f p : f x ≡ f x'</code> when given
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ x'</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f : X → Y</code>.</p>

<p>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ap</code> is already defined in MHE’s Type Topolgy library, we don’t
redefine it here. However, we do define some variations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ap</code> that are
sometimes useful.</p>

<h3 id="function-extensionality">Function extensionality</h3>

<p>Extensional equality of functions, or function extensionality, means
that any two point-wise equal functions are equal. As MHE points out,
this is known to be not provable or disprovable in Martin-Löf Type
Theory (MLTT).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we will mainly work with pointwise equality of functions,
which MHE defines (in <a href="%3Chttps://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology%3E%60_">Type
Topology</a> ) as
follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-agda">_∼_ : {X : 𝓤 ̇ } {A : X → 𝓥 ̇ } → Π A → Π A → 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥 ̇ 
f ∼ g = ∀ x → f x ≡ g x
infix 0 _∼_
</code></pre>

<p>(The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_∼_</code> relation will be equivalent to equality of functions, once we
have the principle of <em>univalence</em> at our disposal.)</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="predicates-subsets">Predicates, Subsets</h3>

<p>We need a mechanism for implementing the notion of subsets in Agda. A
typical one is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pred</code> (for predicate). More generally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pred A 𝓤</code>
can be viewed as the type of a property that elements of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> might
satisfy. We write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P : Pred A 𝓤</code> (read “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> has type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pred A 𝓤</code>”) to
represent the subset of elements of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> that satisfy property <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the definition (which is similar to the one found in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Relation/Unary.agda</code> file of <a href="https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/">Agda standard
library</a> ).</p>

<pre class="Agda">

</pre>

<p>Below we will often consider predicates over the class of all algebras
of a particular type. We will define the type of algebras <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Algebra 𝓤 𝑆</code>
(for some universe level 𝓤). Like all types, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Algebra 𝓤 𝑆</code> itself has a
type which happens to be 𝓞 ⊔ 𝓥 ⊔ 𝓤 ⁺ ̇ (as we will see in algebra type).
Therefore, the type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pred (Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) 𝓤</code> will be 𝓞 ⊔ 𝓥 ⊔ 𝓤 ⁺ ̇ as
well.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pred (Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) 𝓤</code> are maps of the form
𝑨 → 𝓤 ̇; indeed, given an algebra 𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆, we have Pred 𝑨 𝓤 = 𝑨 →
𝓤 ̇.</p>

<h3 id="the-membership-relation">The membership relation</h3>

<p>We introduce notation so that we may indicate that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> “belongs to” a
“subset” <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code>, or that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> “has property” <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code>, by writing either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x ∈ P</code>
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P x</code> (cf. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Relation/Unary.agda</code> in the <a href="https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/">Agda standard

<p>At the end of each chapter of this documentation we show how to produce in Emacs <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/emacs-mode.html">agda2-mode</a> some of the fancy unicode characters that we use in our code.</p>

<p>We hope these hints are convenient for the reader, but they are not meant to be comprehensive.</p>

<p>Instead use these</p>

<p><strong>Emacs commands providing information about special characters/input methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x describe-char</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-m h d c</code>) with the cursor on the character of interest</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x describe-input-method</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-h I</code>)</li>
</ul>
