    Author Response: 
    
    We considered the simplified version of the proof proposed by the referee, and we agree that it results
    in a clearer argument that requires fewer formal definition; we gladly and gratefully adopt the suggested 
    modifications.  Moreover, we expand the discussion of the inconsistency and make it concrete in §7 (see
    Item 2 below). We are confident that neither the previous version of the proof, nor the new and improved
    proof incorporating the suggestions of the referee, suffers from this defect.

    Author Response:
   
    While we did not postulate an inconsistent set of axioms, the defect was that we were not careful to 
    restrict the type X of variable symbols, leaving it arbitrary.  This makes the proof incorrect, since 
    it is not valid for all X, but only those for which there exists surjections onto the algebras in the
    class under consideration.  We have included a more detailed discussion of this oversight in §7.
    Moreover, we now include a link to a formal derivation of the contradiction
    (see https://github.com/ualib/agda-algebras/blob/master/src/Demos/ContraX.lagda).

   Fixed. (We now link to the exact commit, as suggested.)


B. > > The term algebra T X is the absolutely free (or initial) S-algebra.

   > This wording doesn't fit with what follows because it does not mention X explicitly: T Y is also *the*

   AUTHOR RESPONSE:
   
   We removed "initial" and changed it to "The term algebra 𝑻 X is the *absolutely free* 𝑆-algebra over X."

C. > > Let C be the product of all algebras in S K, so C ∈ P (S K).

   > With this sentence, we expect C to be defined as \prod_A\in S K, A, but it turns out this is not

   AUTHOR RESPONSE:
   
   Fixed (by removing the word "all," as suggested).
