\paragraph*{Acknowledgments}
This work would not have been possible without the wonderful \agda language and
the \agdastdlib, developed and maintained by The Agda Team~\cite{agdastdlib}.
We thank the three anonymous referees for carefully reading the manuscript and
offering many excellent suggestions which resulted in a vast improvement in the
overall presentation.  One referee went above and beyond and provided us with a
simpler formalization of free algebras, in particular of \af{ùîΩ[~\ab{X}~]}.
%This is based on image factorization (i.e. epi/mono factorization).
This in turn led to simplifications of the proofs of the main theorem. We are
extremely grateful for this.
