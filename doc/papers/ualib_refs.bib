abstract = {Dependent type theory is a powerful language for writing functional programs with very precise types. It is used to write not only programs but also mathematical proofs that these programs satisfy certain properties. Because of this, languages based on dependent types – such as Coq, Agda, and Idris – are used both as programming languages and as interactive proof assistants. While dependent types give strong guarantees about your programs and proofs, they also impose equally strong requirements on them. This often makes it harder to write programs in a dependently typed language compared to one with a simpler type system. For this reason certain techniques have been developed, such as dependent pattern matching and specialization by unification. These techniques provide an intuitive way to write programs and proofs in dependently typed languages. Previously, dependent pattern matching had only been shown to work in a limited setting. In particular, it relied on the K axiom – also known as the uniqueness of identity proofs – to remove equations of the form x = x. This axiom is inadmissible in many type theories, particularly in the new and promising branch known as homotopy type theory (HoTT). As a result, programs and proofs in these new theories cannot make use of dependent pattern matching and are as a result much harder to write, modify, and understand. Additionally, the interaction of dependent pattern matching with small but practical features such as eta-equality for record types and postponing of unification constraints was poorly understood, resulting in subtle bugs and inconsistencies. In this thesis, we develop dependent pattern matching and unification in a general setting that does not require the K axiom, both from a theoretical perspective and a practical one. In particular, we present a proof-relevant unification algorithm, where each unification rule produces evidence of its correctness. This evidence guarantees that all unification rules are correct by construction, and also gives a computational characterization to each unification rule. To ensure that these techniques are sound and will stay so in face of future extensions to type theory, we show how to translate them to more basic primitive constructs, i.e. the standard datatype eliminators. During this translation, we pay special attention to the computational content of all constructions involved. This guarantees that the intuitions from regular pattern matching carry over to a dependently typed setting. Based on our work, we implemented a complete overhaul of the algorithm for checking definitions by dependent pattern matching in Agda. Our new implementation fixes a substantial number of issues in the old implementation, and is at the same time less restrictive than the old ad-hoc restrictions. Thus it puts the whole system back on a strong foundation. In addition, our work has already been used as the basis for other implementations of dependent pattern matching, such as the Equations package for Coq and the Lean theorem prover. The work in this thesis eliminates all implicit assumptions introduced to the type theory by pattern matching and unification. In the future, we may also want to integrate new principles with pattern matching, for example the higher inductive types introduced by HoTT. The framework presented in this thesis also provides a solid basis for such extensions to be built on.}

abstract="In these lecture notes we give an introduction to functional programming with dependent types. We use the dependently typed programming language Agda which is an extension of Martin-L{\"o}f type theory. First we show how to do simply typed functional programming in the style of Haskell and ML. Some differences between Agda's type system and the Hindley-Milner type system of Haskell and ML are also discussed. Then we show how to use dependent types for programming and we explain the basic ideas behind type-checking dependent types. We go on to explain the Curry-Howard identification of propositions and types. This is what makes Agda a programming logic and not only a programming language. According to Curry-Howard, we identify programs and proofs, something which is possible only by requiring that all program terminate. However, at the end of these notes we present a method for encoding partial and general recursive functions as total functions using dependent types.",

First, the class considered is assumed to contain a generic family, which is defined to be a set-indexed family of algebras such that if an identity is valid in every algebra of this family, it is valid in every algebra of the class.

abstract="This paper introduces an expressive class of quotient-inductive types, called QW-types. We show that in dependent type theory with uniqueness of identity proofs, even the infinitary case of QW-types can be encoded using the combination of inductive-inductive definitions involving strictly positive occurrences of Hofmann-style quotient types, and Abel's size types. The latter, which provide a convenient constructive abstraction of what classically would be accomplished with transfinite ordinals, are used to prove termination of the recursive definitions of the elimination and computation properties of our encoding of QW-types. The development is formalized using the Agda theorem prover.",

  ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes generic design patterns to define and combine algebraic structures, using dependent records, coercions and type inference, inside the Coq system. This alternative to telescopes in particular supports multiple inheritance, maximal sharing of notations and theories, and automated structure inference. Our methodology is robust enough to handle a hierarchy comprising a broad variety of algebraic structures, from types with a choice operator to algebraically closed fields. Interfaces for the structures enjoy the convenience of a classical setting, without requiring any axiom. Finally, we present two applications of our proof techniques: a key lemma for characterising the discrete logarithm, and a matrix decomposition problem.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this work we present a novel formalization of universal algebra in Agda. We show that heterogeneous signatures can be elegantly modelled in type-theory using sets indexed by arities to represent operations. We prove elementary results of heterogeneous algebras, including the proof that the term algebra is initial and the proofs of the three isomorphism theorems. We further formalize equational theory and prove soundness and completeness. At the end, we define (derived) signature morphisms, from which we get the contravariant functor between algebras; moreover, we also proved that, under some restrictions, the translation of a theory induces a contra-variant functor between models.}

        abstract = {Martin-Lof's intuitionistic type theory (Type Theory) is a formal system that serves not only as a foundation of constructive mathematics but also as a dependently typed programming language. Dependent types are types that depend on values of other types. Type Theory is based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism which relates computer programs with mathematical proofs so that we can do computer-aided formal reasoning and write certified programs in programming languages like Agda, Epigram etc. Martin Lof proposed two variants of Type Theory which are differentiated by the treatment of equality. In Intensional Type Theory, propositional equality defined by identity types does not imply definitional equality, and type checking is decidable. In Extensional Type Theory, propositional equality is identified with definitional equality which makes type checking undecidable. Because of the good computational properties, Intensional Type Theory is more popular, however it lacks some important extensional concepts such as functional extensionality and quotient types.
This thesis is about quotient types. A quotient type is a new type whose equality is redefined by a given equivalence relation. However, in the usual formulation of Intensional Type Theory, there is no type former to create a quotient. We also lose canonicity if we add quotient types into Intensional Type Theory as axioms. In this thesis, we first investigate the expected syntax of quotient types and explain it with categorical notions. For quotients which can be represented as a setoid as well as defined as a set without a quotient type former, we propose to define an algebraic structure of quotients called definable quotients. It relates the setoid interpretation and the set definition via a normalisation function which returns a normal form (canonical choice) for each equivalence class. It can be seen as a simulation of quotient types and it helps theorem proving because we can benefit from both representations. However this approach cannot be used for all quotients. It seems that we cannot define a normalisation function for some quotients in Type Theory, e.g. Cauchy reals and finite multisets. Quotient types are indeed essential for formalisation of mathematics and reasoning of programs. Then we consider some models of Type Theory where types are interpreted as structured objects such as setoids, groupoids or weak omega-groupoids. In these models equalities are internalised into types which means that it is possible to redefine equalities. We present an implementation of Altenkirch's setoid model and show that quotient types can be defined within this model. We also describe a new extension of Martin-Lof type theory called Homotopy Type Theory where types are interpreted as weak omega-groupoids. It can be seen as a generalisation of the groupoid model which makes extensional concepts including quotient types available. We also introduce a syntactic encoding of weak omega-groupoids which can be seen as a first step towards building a weak omega-groupoids model in Intensional Type Theory. All of these implementations were performed in the dependently typed programming language Agda which is based on intensional Martin-Lof type theory.}
