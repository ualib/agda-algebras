Let 𝑇ₙ be a totally ordered set of size 𝑛.  Let 𝐴 be a set (the alphabet).
We can model the set 𝑊ₙ, of *words* (strings of letters from 𝐴) of length 𝑛
by the type 𝑇ₙ → 𝐴 of functions from 𝑇ₙ to 𝐴.

The set of all (finite length) words is then

\[ W = ⋃[n ∈ ℕ] Wₙ \]

The *length* of a word 𝑥 is given by the function `size x`, which will be defined below.

An *algorithm* is a computer program with infinite memory (i.e., a Turing machine).

A function 𝑓 : 𝑊 → 𝑊 is *computable in polynomial time* if there exist an
algorithm and numbers 𝑐, 𝑑 ∈ ℕ such that for each word 𝑥 ∈ 𝑊 the algorithm
stops in at most (size 𝑥) 𝑐 + 𝑑 steps and computes 𝑓 𝑥.

At first we will simplify by assuming 𝑇ₙ is `Fin n`.
