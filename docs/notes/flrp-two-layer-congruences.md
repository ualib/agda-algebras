# FLRP design note: the two-layer congruence discipline for finite algebras

This note records the design discussion triggered by the constructivity no-go theorem `chain₂-ConIso→WLEM` of `FLRP.Problem` (PR #462, work package WP-1, issue #452) and proposes the architecture that the FLRP program should adopt in response.  Companion documents: the roadmap `docs/notes/flrp-research-roadmap.md` (§§ 6–7), the finite-Birkhoff note `docs/notes/m6-8-finite-birkhoff.md`, and the modules `Setoid.Algebras.Finite` and `Setoid.Congruences.Finite` (split out of `Setoid.Subalgebras.Subdirect.Finite` by #465 after this note was first drafted).  Status: **ratified 2026-07-12** — the § 6 decision points are resolved below and the decision is promoted to ADR-008 (`docs/adr/008-two-layer-congruence-discipline.md`); implementation is tracked by work package WP-7.

## 1. The trigger, and the question it raises

WP-1 formalized the FLRP statement and proved, instead of the expected two-element instance, a no-go theorem: any order isomorphism `Con 𝑨 ≅ chain₂` — over any signature and any algebra — yields weak excluded middle, because `Con 𝑨` contains the *switch congruence* `θ[ P ] = Cg (λ _ _ → P)` for every proposition `P`, and reading off where the isomorphism sends it decides between `¬ P` and `¬ ¬ P`.  Consequently `Representable` is constructively inhabited only by the one-element lattice.

The review question (PR #462): is this a fundamental flaw in how the library defines congruences?  Should it even be possible to form `Cg (λ _ _ → P)`?  Should every definable congruence be reconstructible from the pairs that generate it, and shouldn't we always be able to decide which element of a congruence lattice corresponds to `Δ` and which to `∇`?

This note's answers, defended below: the definition of `Con` is correct and must not change; the no-go does not contradict the library's earlier decidability results but rather locates their classical content precisely; and the review's two closing principles — reconstructibility from generating pairs, and computability of `Δ`/`∇` identification — are exactly the *defining properties of a second, decidable layer* that the program should now build and quantify over.

## 2. Diagnosis

### 2.1 No contradiction with the existing decidability results

`Setoid.Congruences.Finite` provides `DecCon` — a congruence packaged with a decidability witness — with decidable pair-membership (`_∈?_`), and its `FiniteCongruences` interface carries a finite list `cons` of `DecCon`s together with the field `complete : (φ : Con 𝑨 ℓ) → Σ[ d ] (d ∈ cons) × (φ ≑ proj₁ d)`; the carrier-level data (decidable `≈`, finite surjective enumeration) lives separately in the bare `FiniteAlgebra` of `Setoid.Algebras.Finite`.  The module prose already observes that carrier-finiteness plus decidable `≈` do *not* make congruences decidable, gives the switch congruence as the example, and calls `complete` "exactly the classical content" of finiteness.  The WP-1 theorem is the machine-checked sharpening of that remark: `complete` on any nontrivial algebra implies weak excluded middle, and full excluded middle at the working level implies `complete`, so the field's strength sits in the interval between WLEM and LEM (pinning it exactly is a nice side question, not needed for the design).  Earlier decidability facts concern `DecCon`; the no-go concerns bare `Con`; both are true, and together they quarantine the classical content in a single named field.

### 2.2 Why `Cg (λ _ _ → P)` cannot and should not be banned

The switch congruence is not encoding junk; it is a **kernel**.  Quotient the carrier setoid by `x ∼ y iff x ≈ y ∨ P`; the kernel of the quotient map is `θ[ P ]`.  Any definition with "congruence = compatible equivalence relation" — which is what kernels, the isomorphism theorems (`Setoid.Homomorphisms.Noether`), quotient algebras, subdirect representation, free algebras, and the HSP theorem consume, including for infinite algebras — contains switch congruences.  Restricting the definition to Bool-valued relations or to relations-given-by-generators would break the kernel property (homomorphisms into arbitrary setoids have undecidable kernels) and with it the core of the `Setoid` tree.

The deeper fact: constructively, `Con 𝟚` *is not* the two-element lattice — a congruence on a bare two-element carrier is determined by the proposition "the two elements are related", so `Con 𝟚` is canonically the lattice of level-`0ℓ` propositions up to logical equivalence.  Demanding `Con 𝟚 ≅ 𝟚` is demanding that the lattice of truth values be `𝟚`, i.e. excluded middle.  No re-encoding escapes this, including the planned Cubical port: Prop-valued is not decidable there either.  The semantic `Con` faithfully mirrors the ambient logic; the repair is not to change the semantic object but to stop asking it computational questions.

### 2.3 The review's principles, relocated

+  **Reconstructibility**.  For a decidable congruence `d` on a finite algebra, the list of its related pairs is finite data, and `proj₁ d ≑ Cg ⟨related pairs⟩` holds constructively (`base` gives one inclusion, `Cg-least` the other).  Conversely, `Cg` of a finite pair list on a *finite finitary* algebra (§ 3) has decidable membership.  So "reconstructible from its generating pairs" is not a constraint one can impose on `Con`; it is precisely the characterization of the decidable layer.
+  **Computing `Δ` and `∇`**.  On the decidable layer, `Δ` is the unique list entry relating no distinct enumerated pair, found by running `_∈?_`; the corresponding identification under any isomorphism is a computation, exactly as the review demands.

## 3. The design

Terminology (standard, with the constructive readings pinned down).  A **finite finitary signature** has a finite type of operation symbols, each of finite arity; a **finite finitary algebra** is an algebra over a finite finitary signature with a finite carrier.  Constructively, "finite carrier" needs one clarification.  For a *bijective* enumeration (Bishop-finiteness, `Fin n ≃ carrier`) decidable equality is derivable — `x ≈ y` exactly when the indices agree — so carrier-finiteness in that sense does imply decidable equality.  For a merely *surjective* enumeration it does not: glue two points along a proposition `P` (`x ≈ y iff x ≡ y ∨ P`); the identity map still enumerates the carrier, yet deciding `0 ≈ 1` decides `P`.  The library's `FiniteAlgebra` carrier data — a surjective enumeration *plus* an explicit `_≟_` field — is chosen because surjective enumerations pass to quotients for free: `G/H` is the same carrier under a coarser equality, so the WP-2 coset algebras stay finite finitary with no choice of coset representatives; and the two fields together are equivalent to Bishop-finiteness (deduplicate the enumeration using `_≟_`).  `Sig-Lattice` is finite finitary; `Sig-Unary A` is finite finitary whenever `A` is the carrier of a finite group, so the WP-2 coset algebras and the WP-3 bridge fall inside this scope.  One caution keeps § 2.2 in view: finiteness of the carrier decides equality of *elements*, never membership in arbitrary *predicates or relations* over them — the switch congruence lives one level up, which is why the decidable layer is a discipline and not a corollary of finiteness.

The proposal is a **two-layer discipline**:

+  **Layer S (semantic, existing)**.  `Con 𝑨` stays exactly as is, and remains the home of the general theory — kernels, quotients, Noether, subdirect representation, HSP — and of impossibility results such as the no-go.
+  **Layer D (decidable, to build)**.  Finitely presented congruences and `DecCon` become first-class, with the following lemma stack.

The lemma stack (statements the implementation must realize; names indicative):

+  **L1 (presentation decidability)**.  On a finite finitary algebra, membership in `Cg R` is decidable for every finite pair list `R`: the congruence closure of `R ∪ Δ` under symmetry, transitivity, and the finitely many finite-arity operations stabilizes on a finite carrier.  Hence `Cg R` upgrades to a `DecCon`.
+  **L2 (reconstruction)**.  On a finite algebra, every `DecCon` is `≑` to `Cg` of its related-pairs list; combined with L1, the finitely presented congruences and the decidable congruences coincide up to `≑` on finite finitary algebras.
+  **L3 (constructive completeness for the decidable layer)**.  On a finite finitary algebra one can enumerate all Bool-valued binary tables on `Fin card`, filter the compatible equivalences, and prove the resulting list complete for `DecCon` up to `≑` — with no classical axiom.  This yields a fully constructive congruence-side interface — working name `FiniteCongruencesᵈ`, a `DecCon`-complete list with constructively proven completeness, the decidable-layer counterpart of the `FiniteCongruences` record of #465; the carrier-level `FiniteAlgebra` of `Setoid.Algebras.Finite` is already free of classical content.  Feasibility note: the enumeration is exponential and exists for the sake of the completeness *proof*; in practice the list is supplied by certificates (WP-6), not by running the enumeration.
+  **L4 (the single classical bridge)**.  The `complete` field of `FiniteCongruences` — every semantic congruence is `≑` to a decidable one — becomes the *one* registered classical assumption of the program (planned `FLRP.Assumptions`), stated once and imported explicitly by any result that genuinely needs to pass from Layer S to Layer D.  Its strength (between WLEM and LEM, § 2.1) is documented at the registration site.
+  **L5 (`Representableᵈ`)**.  The poset of `DecCon`s up to `≑` on a finite finitary algebra is a finite lattice with decidable order; `Representableᵈ 𝑳` asserts an order isomorphism from it to `𝑳`, and `FLRP-Statementᵈ` quantifies as before.  Deliverables: the constructive instance for `chain₂` (a decidable congruence on `𝟚` decides its own value at the distinct pair, so the obstruction of § 1 vanishes); and, under L4, the equivalence `Representable 𝑳 ↔ Representableᵈ 𝑳`.

Interpretation: `Representableᵈ` becomes the program's working notion, and it is arguably the *more faithful* formalization of the informal FLRP — the "finite algebra" of Pálfy–Pudlák and of every UACalc computation is the finite finitary object with concretely presented congruences.  `Representable` (Layer S) remains the stated semantic form, the two connected by L4 exactly once.

## 4. Audit tasks

+  **A1**.  Determine which downstream consumers of the finiteness interfaces use `complete` essentially — in particular whether `finiteSubdirectSIRep` and finite Birkhoff (M6-8) survive on the constructive data (bare `FiniteAlgebra` plus `FiniteCongruencesᵈ`) alone or genuinely need the bridge; either answer is informative and belongs in the m6-8 note as an addendum.
+  **A2**.  Check that the WP-2 group modules need no change: for finite groups carrying the standard finiteness data, subgroup membership, normality, cores, cosets, and intervals in `Sub(G)` are decidable, so the WP-3 bridge should be stated at Layer D from the start.
+  **A3**.  Fix the Agda packaging of finite finitary signatures/algebras (a `FiniteSignature` record versus fields on `FiniteAlgebraᵈ`), respecting the one-canonical-form rule; the *terminology* is now fixed (finite finitary, § 6), only the packaging remains open.

## 5. Impact on the work packages

+  **WP-1 (#452, PR #462)**.  No change required; the module already frames `Representable` as the semantic statement and names the decidable reformulation as its sequel.  This note supersedes that one-line pointer with a concrete design.
+  **WP-3 (#454)**.  State `Con (G ↷ G/H) ≅ [H, G]` at Layer D (finite groups with the standard finiteness data); the Layer S version follows under L4 if ever needed.
+  **WP-4 (#455) and RP-1 (#458)**.  Unaffected in substance: the enforceability framework lives on the group side, where tabulated data keeps everything decidable.
+  **WP-6 (#457)**.  Certificates target `Representableᵈ`, as WP-1 already flagged; L1–L3 are the checker's mathematical core.
+  **New work package (WP-7, filed as #466)**.  Implement L1–L5 and the audits A1–A3; PR-sized slices: (i) L1+L2, (ii) L3 + `FiniteCongruencesᵈ`, (iii) L4 registration + L5 with the `chain₂` instance.

## 6. Decision points — resolved 2026-07-12

+  **Naming**: `Representable` keeps its name, with `Representableᵈ` alongside.  Ratified as proposed.
+  **Ordering**: the finiteness-interface refactor lands before WP-3.  Ratified as proposed; #465 has since delivered the module split (`Setoid.Algebras.Finite` / `Setoid.Congruences.Finite`), and WP-7 (#466) delivers L3/L4 proper.
+  **Terminology**: the standard name **finite finitary algebra** replaces the draft's "tabulated algebra" throughout (reviewer's amendment, adopted in § 3); the constructive content — surjective enumeration plus decidable equality, jointly equivalent to Bishop-finiteness, chosen for quotient-compatibility — is recorded in § 3, and only the Agda packaging remains open (audit A3).
+  **ADR**: promoted to `docs/adr/008-two-layer-congruence-discipline.md`, since the discipline constrains all future finite-algebra work, not only the FLRP tree.  Ratified.
