# M6-2 design note: subdirect products, subdirectly irreducible algebras, and Birkhoff's subdirect representation theorem

This note records the first pass of [M6-2][] (#272) — *subdirect products and
subdirectly irreducible algebras* — the foundational FLRP-prerequisite that the M6
track skipped over when it did congruence permutability (M6-3/#273) and the CP converse
(M6-4/M6-5, #410/#411) first.  Read it alongside the M6 milestone description in
[`GITHUB_PROJECT.md`][] and the merged congruence-lattice work
(`Setoid.Congruences.{Lattice,Generation,CompleteLattice}`).

The deliverable mirrors M6-3's discipline: the **constructive core is proved in full**,
and the one genuinely choice-dependent statement (the *existence* half of Birkhoff's
theorem) is isolated as an explicit module parameter rather than postulated, so the
library stays postulate-free under `--safe`.

## What landed

Two modules, both `--cubical-compatible --exact-split --safe`.

+  `Setoid.Congruences.Monolith` — pure congruence theory; the order-theoretic content
   of subdirect irreducibility.
   +  `Nontrivial 𝑨` / `Trivial 𝑨` — the carrier has two `≈`-distinct elements / all
      elements are `≈`-equal (the degenerate one-element case); `trivial⇒¬nontrivial`.
   +  `BelowDiagonal θ` (`θ` relates only `≈`-equal elements, i.e. `θ ≑ 0ᴬ`) and its
      negation `Nonzero θ` (the right "strictly above `0ᴬ`" notion).
   +  `⋂` — the meet (intersection) of an `ℓ`-small family of `ℓ`-level congruences, at
      the algebra's own relation level (the natural-level instance of the `⋀` that
      `Setoid.Congruences.CompleteLattice` packages at the absorbing level `L`).
   +  `IsMonolith μ` — `μ` is nonzero and is contained in every nonzero congruence (the
      least nonzero congruence); `HasMonolith`; `monolith-unique` (the monolith is
      unique up to `≑`, the mutual-containment equivalence on congruences).
   +  `IsSubdirectlyIrreducible 𝑨 = Nontrivial 𝑨 × HasMonolith 𝑨`, with `si⇒nontrivial`
      and `trivial⇒¬si`.
   +  `monolith⇒cmi` — the characterization: a monolith makes `0ᴬ` *completely
      meet-irreducible*; and `monolith⇒∧-irreducible` — its binary instance, the meet of
      two nonzero congruences is nonzero ("`0ᴬ` is meet-irreducible", the
      directly-indecomposable-adjacent fact).

+  `Setoid.Subalgebras.Subdirect` — the subdirect structures and the bridge.  (Later
   reorganized under M6-8 into a `Subdirect` barrel: the structures and the bridge in
   `Subdirect.Basic`, the Birkhoff reduction in `Subdirect.BirkhoffSI`, and the finite
   discharge in `Subdirect.Finite`.)
   +  `⨅-proj` — the coordinate projection `⨅ 𝒜 → 𝒜 i` as a homomorphism (originally
      re-derived in `Subdirect` to drop a vestigial domain parameter; under M6-8
      promoted to `Setoid.Homomorphisms.Products` as `⨅-proj` and imported from there).
   +  `coord h i = projᵢ ∘ h` and `IsSubdirectEmbedding` (a hom that is injective and
      whose every coordinate map is surjective); `SubdirectEmbedding`; `subdirect→≤`
      (a subdirect embedding is in particular a subalgebra inclusion `𝑩 ≤ ⨅ 𝒜`).
   +  **The bridge.**  For a family `θ : I → Con 𝑨`, the natural map
      `natmap = ⨅-hom-co (πhom ∘ θ) : 𝑨 → ⨅ (λ i → 𝑨 ╱ θ i)`.  `Separates θ` says the
      meet `⋂ θ` is the diagonal (`∀ i, θ i a b ⟹ a ≈ b`).  Then `natmap-injective` /
      `natmap-separates` show injectivity of the natural map is **definitionally** the
      separation property, and `natmap-proj-onto` shows each coordinate map *is* the
      canonical quotient epimorphism, hence surjective — with no decidability or choice
      on the index.  `separating→SubdirectEmbedding` assembles them.
   +  **Birkhoff, reduced to existence.**  `SubdirectlyRepresentable 𝑨` (a family of SI
      algebras with a subdirect embedding of `𝑨` into their product) is the theorem's
      conclusion.  `SubdirectSIRep 𝑨` packages the bridge's input: a separating family
      whose quotients are all subdirectly irreducible.  `SIRep→Representable` is the
      fully-constructive reduction, and `Birkhoff-subdirect` is the theorem relative to
      the choice principle `(∀ 𝑨 → SubdirectSIRep 𝑨)`.

## The injectivity-is-separation identity

The technical pleasantness of the bridge is that the two halves are *definitional*, not
just provable.  The image of `a : 𝕌[ 𝑨 ]` under `natmap` is its tuple of congruence
classes `λ i → a`, and equality in `⨅ (λ i → 𝑨 ╱ θ i)` at that tuple unfolds to
`∀ i → proj₁ (θ i) a b` — exactly the hypothesis of `Separates`.  So
`IsInjective (proj₁ natmap)` and `Separates θ` are the *same type* — a fact we record
with a `refl`-checked `IsInjective (proj₁ natmap) ≡ Separates` (propositional `≡`) — and
`natmap-injective = id`.  Likewise `coord 𝑨╱ natmap i` reduces to the canonical
projection `πepi 𝒾𝒹 (θ i)`, so its surjectivity is `IsEpi.isSurjective` of that epi
verbatim.  This is the formal content of the brief's "injectivity is exactly *the meet is
the diagonal*".

## The choice decision for Birkhoff (option (a))

Birkhoff's subdirect representation theorem needs, for each pair `a ≢ b`, a congruence
**maximal** among those not relating `a , b`.  Such a congruence is completely
meet-irreducible, so its quotient is subdirectly irreducible, and the family of these
(over all distinct pairs) meets to the diagonal.  Producing the maximal congruence is a
Zorn's-lemma step: incompatible with postulate-free `--safe`.

The brief offered three ways to handle this; we took **(a)**: state the theorem relative
to an explicit choice principle taken as a module parameter.  Concretely
`Birkhoff-subdirect` abstracts over `sirep : (𝑨 : Algebra α ρ) → SubdirectSIRep 𝑨 ℓ ι`
and derives `SubdirectlyRepresentable 𝑨` for every `𝑨`.  The choice-free half — *given
the SI quotients with meet `0ᴬ`, you get the subdirect embedding* — is `SIRep→Representable`
and is proved unconditionally, so the theorem reduces to *exactly* the choice-dependent
existence claim `∀ 𝑨 → SubdirectSIRep 𝑨`, as the brief asks.

Why `SubdirectSIRep` (a separating SI-family) rather than the more atomic "for each
`a ≢ b`, a separating cmi congruence" as the parameter?  Because turning the per-pair
congruences into a family with meet *exactly* the diagonal is itself non-constructive.
Indexing by distinct pairs, the separation proof for a fixed `a , b` must inspect whether
`a ≈ b` to form the index `(a , b , _)`, which yields only `¬ ¬ (a ≈ b)`; recovering
`a ≈ b` needs `≈` to be stable (decidable equality, or a double-negation elimination).
That stability is precisely the classical input, so we fold it into the parameter and
take the directly-usable `SubdirectSIRep` — a separating family in the constructively
strong sense — as the assumption.  Option (b) (the finite/decidable case, where `≈` *is*
decidable and the maximal separating congruence is found by search over a finite
congruence lattice) is the natural way to *discharge* this parameter constructively for
finite algebras; it is left as a follow-up.  We did not take option (c) (state-and-defer
as a checked `Type`), since (a) both states the assumption and proves the theorem from it.

## The monolith characterization and its converse

`monolith⇒cmi` is stated in **contrapositive** form: *if every member of a family is
nonzero, the meet is nonzero*.  This is the constructively honest reading of "`0ᴬ` is
completely meet-irreducible" — the textbook form "`⋀ θ ≑ 0ᴬ ⟹ ∃ i, θ i ≑ 0ᴬ`" would
require extracting a witnessing index from a negated statement.  The proof is immediate
from the monolith: `μ ⊆ θ i` for every `i`, so `μ ⊆ ⋀ θ`, and `μ` nonzero forces `⋀ θ`
nonzero.

The **converse** (`0ᴬ` completely meet-irreducible ⟹ a monolith exists) is *not* added.
The natural construction takes `μ = ⋀ {θ : θ nonzero}`, the meet of all nonzero
congruences; but that family is indexed by `Σ[ θ ∈ Con 𝑨 ℓ ] Nonzero θ`, which lives one
universe up, so the resulting meet is a `Con 𝑨 ℓ′` with `ℓ′ > ℓ` — it is not a monolith
*at level `ℓ`*.  This is the same predicativity wall that the complete-lattice
construction meets (its completeness is only for `ℓ₀`-small families).  Stating the
converse cleanly would need an impredicative meet; we record it here as a known limitation
rather than forcing a level-bumped statement.  The forward direction is the one consumed
downstream.

## Levels

The congruence level of an SI algebra is fixed to the algebra's **own relation level**
`ρ`: for `𝑨 : Algebra α ρ` the diagonal `0ᴬ` is the setoid equality `_≈_ : Con 𝑨 ρ` and
the monolith (when present) is a `Con 𝑨 ρ`, so `IsSubdirectlyIrreducible` carries no
extra level parameter.  This is the natural predicative choice; a level-generic variant
is possible but unnecessary for the present clients.  The bridge keeps the family level
`ℓ` and index level `ι` generic (the product `⨅` lands at `Algebra (α ⊔ ι)(ℓ ⊔ ι)`, per
the standard product level arithmetic), so the Birkhoff index can be the
`(α ⊔ ρ)`-level type of distinct pairs without forcing `ℓ = ρ`.

## Homes and naming

+  Monolith/SI live under `Setoid.Congruences.` because they are congruence-lattice
   notions and depend only on `Setoid.Congruences.{Basic,Lattice}`; putting them under
   `Setoid.Algebras.` would invert the layering (Algebras is below Congruences).
+  Subdirect products/embeddings and Birkhoff live under `Setoid.Subalgebras.` (a
   subdirect product *is* a subalgebra of a product); the development imports `Monolith`
   for the SI predicate, a clean one-way dependency.  Under M6-8 the single `Subdirect`
   module became a `Subdirect` barrel re-exporting `Subdirect.Basic` (the structures and
   the bridge), `Subdirect.BirkhoffSI` (the SI-representation theorem), and
   `Subdirect.Finite` (the finite discharge), since `Subdirect.Basic` is now shared by
   the latter two.
+  The theorem is `Birkhoff-subdirect`, distinct from the HSP variety theorem's
   `Birkhoff` (`Setoid.Varieties.HSP`), so both can be re-exported through the top-level
   `Setoid` barrel without an ambiguous-name clash.  (The SI-representation theorem's
   module is named `BirkhoffSI` for the same reason — to keep it distinct from the HSP
   `Birkhoff`.)

## The structural characterization (M6-10)

[M6-10][] (#421) adds `Setoid.Subalgebras.Subdirect.Irreducible`, tying `IsSubdirectlyIrreducible`
(Monolith) to the subdirect structures (`Subdirect.Basic`) — the equivalence that makes
"subdirectly irreducible" name what it does: `𝑨` is SI iff it has no nontrivial subdirect
decomposition, i.e. every subdirect embedding `𝑨 ↪ ⨅ 𝒜` has an isomorphism coordinate.

+  **The kernel bridges are definitional**.  For `h : 𝑨 → ⨅ 𝒜` the kernel family
   `kerfam h i = kercon (coord 𝒜 h i)` makes three identities hold on the nose (recorded as
   `id`, exactly the `natmap` injectivity-is-separation pattern): `BelowDiagonal (kerfam i)`
   *is* `IsInjective (coord h i)` (`coord-inj→below` / `below→coord-inj`); injectivity of
   `h` *is* `Separates kerfam` (`embed→separates` / `separates→embed`), since equality in
   `⨅ 𝒜` is pointwise; and — the one bridge with content — a surjective and injective
   coordinate map is an isomorphism (`coord-iso`, via the new generic `Bijective→≅` added to
   `Setoid.Homomorphisms.Isomorphisms`).
+  **The constructive direction**.  `monolith⇒¬all-nonzero` is `monolith⇒cmi` read on the
   separation predicate (`separates≡below-meet` records the definitional identity
   `Separates θ ≡ BelowDiagonal (⋂ θ)` for a `ρ`-small index): a monolithic `𝑨` whose
   kernel family separates points cannot have all coordinates proper.  The direct proof
   drops the `ρ`-small-index restriction that `⋂` imposes, so it covers the `Fin n`-indexed
   case.  At the embedding level this is `si⇒¬no-iso-coord : ¬ (∀ i → ¬ (𝑨 ≅ 𝒜 i))`, the
   choice-free contrapositive form.
+  **The finite witness**.  `si⇒iso-coord` extracts an *explicit* isomorphic coordinate
   `∃[ i ] 𝑨 ≅ 𝒜 i` for a `Fin n` index given a decision of `BelowDiagonal (kerfam i)` per
   coordinate, via `¬∀⟶∃¬` and `decidable-stable` (the same finite toolset as [M6-8][]).
   Decidable `≈` on a finite carrier makes that `Π`-over-pairs decision go through, so a
   `FiniteAlgebra` supplies the data — the constructive, witness-producing reading of the
   characterization.
+  **The converse**.  The family-level converse `iso-coord⟹¬all-proper` (an injective
   coordinate forces the kernel family not-all-nonzero) is choice-free.  The full
   *structural ⟹ monolith* is not added: the natural witness `μ = ⋀ {θ : Nonzero θ}` is
   indexed by `Σ[ θ ∈ Con 𝑨 ρ ] Nonzero θ`, a universe up, so the meet is a `Con 𝑨 ℓ′` with
   `ℓ′ > ρ` — not a monolith *at level `ρ`*; and the finite escape fails too, since the
   constructive complete congruence lists (`FiniteCongruences.cons`, [M6-8][], relocated
   to `Setoid.Congruences.Finite` by #464) live at the
   absorbing level `clv α ρ ⊒ ρ`.  This is the same predicativity wall as the
   `cmi ⟹ monolith` direction above (and [M6-9][]); recorded, not forced.

## What remains (follow-ups)

+  ~~The constructive finite case (option (b)): for an algebra with decidable `≈` and a
   finite congruence lattice, *discharge* `SubdirectSIRep` by searching for maximal
   separating congruences — turning `Birkhoff-subdirect` into an unconditional theorem on
   finite algebras.~~  **Done in [M6-8][] (#419)**: `Setoid.Subalgebras.Subdirect.Finite`
   constructs `finiteSubdirectSIRep` / `finite-Birkhoff` by a count-based maximal-congruence
   search over a finite, complete list of decidable congruences.  See the design note
   [`m6-8-finite-birkhoff.md`][], which records why the complete congruence enumeration
   must be part of the finiteness interface (it is not derivable from carrier-finiteness
   plus decidable `≈` alone).
+  The impredicative converse `cmi ⟹ monolith`, if/when the library adopts an
   impredicative or resized meet.
+  ~~Connecting `IsSubdirectlyIrreducible` to the *absence of a nontrivial subdirect
   decomposition* (an SI algebra's every subdirect embedding has an isomorphism
   coordinate) — the equivalence that makes "subdirectly irreducible" name what it
   does.~~  **Done in [M6-10][] (#421)**: `Setoid.Subalgebras.Subdirect.Irreducible` proves the
   constructive direction (contrapositive `si⇒¬no-iso-coord`, and the finite
   witness-extracting `si⇒iso-coord`) and records the converse's predicativity cost; see
   "The structural characterization (M6-10)" above.
